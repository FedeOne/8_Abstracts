TI  - Effect of Long-term Continuous Cardiac Monitoring vs Usual Care on Detection of 
      Atrial Fibrillation in Patients With Stroke Attributed to Large- or Small-Vessel 
      Disease: The STROKE-AF Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 2169-2177
LID - 10.1001/jama.2021.6470 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Patients with ischemic stroke attributed to large- or small-vessel 
      disease are not considered at high risk for atrial fibrillation (AF), and the AF 
      incidence rate in this population is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether 
      long-term cardiac monitoring is more effective than usual care for AF detection 
      in patients with stroke attributed to large- or small-vessel disease through 12 
      months of follow-up. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The STROKE-AF trial was a 
      randomized (1:1), multicenter (33 sites in the US) clinical trial that enrolled 
      496 patients between April 2016 and July 2019, with primary end point follow-up 
      through August 2020. Eligible patients were aged 60 years or older or aged 50 to 
      59 years with at least 1 additional stroke risk factor and had an index stroke 
      attributed to large- or small-vessel disease within 10 days prior to insertable 
      cardiac monitor (ICM) insertion. INTERVENTIONS: Patients randomized to the 
      intervention group (n = 242) received ICM insertion within 10 days of the index 
      stroke; patients in the control group (n = 250) received site-specific usual care 
      consisting of external cardiac monitoring, such as 12-lead electrocardiograms, 
      Holter monitoring, telemetry, or event recorders. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 
      Incident AF lasting more than 30 seconds through 12 months. RESULTS: Among 492 
      patients who were randomized (mean [SD] age, 67.1 [9.4] years; 185 [37.6%] 
      women), 417 (84.8%) completed 12 months of follow-up. The median (interquartile 
      range) CHA2DS2-VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, 
      diabetes mellitus, stroke or transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, age 65 
      to 74 years, sex category) score was 5 (4-6). AF detection at 12 months was 
      significantly higher in the ICM group vs the control group (27 patients [12.1%] 
      vs 4 patients [1.8%]; hazard ratio, 7.4 [95% CI, 2.6-21.3]; P < .001). Among the 
      221 patients in the ICM group who received an ICM, 4 (1.8%) had ICM 
      procedure-related adverse events (1 site infection, 2 incision site hemorrhages, 
      and 1 implant site pain). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with stroke 
      attributed to large- or small-vessel disease, monitoring with an ICM compared 
      with usual care detected significantly more AF over 12 months. However, further 
      research is needed to understand whether identifying AF in these patients is of 
      clinical importance. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:

TI  - Cilostazol Versus Aspirin on White Matter Changes in Cerebral Small Vessel 
      Disease: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 698-709
LID - 10.1161/STROKEAHA.121.035766 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral small vessel disease is characterized by 
      progressive cerebral white matter changes (WMCs). This study aimed to compare the 
      effects of cilostazol and aspirin on changes in WMC volume in patients with 
      cerebral small vessel disease. METHODS: In a multicenter, double-blind, 
      randomized controlled trial, participants with moderate or severe WMCs and at 
      least one lacunar infarction detected on brain magnetic resonance imaging were 
      randomly assigned to the cilostazol and aspirin groups in a 1:1 ratio. Cilostazol 
      slow release (200 mg) or aspirin (100 mg) capsules were administered once daily 
      for 2 years. The primary outcome was the change in WMC volume on magnetic 
      resonance images from baseline to 2 years. Secondary imaging outcomes include 
      changes in the number of lacunes or cerebral microbleeds, fractional anisotropy, 
      and mean diffusivity on diffusion tensor images, and brain atrophy. Secondary 
      clinical outcomes include all ischemic strokes, all ischemic vascular events, and 
      changes in cognition, motor function, mood, urinary symptoms, and disability. 
      RESULTS: Between July 2013 and August 2016, 256 participants were randomly 
      assigned to the cilostazol (n=127) and aspirin (n=129) groups. Over 2 years, the 
      percentage of WMC volume to total WM volume and the percentage of WMC volume to 
      intracranial volume increased in both groups, but neither analysis showed 
      significant differences between the groups. The peak height of the mean 
      diffusivity histogram in normal-appearing WMs was significantly reduced in the 
      aspirin group compared with the cilostazol group. Cilostazol significantly 
      reduced the risk of ischemic vascular event compared with aspirin (0.5 versus 4.5 
      cases per 100 person-years; hazard ratio, 0.11 [95% CI, 0.02-0.89]). CONCLUSIONS: 
      There was no significant difference between the effects of cilostazol and aspirin 
      on WMC progression in patients with cerebral small vessel disease. Registration:

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to compare the performance of a novel drug-coated 
      balloon (DCB) (Elutax SV, Aachen Resonance, Germany), with an everolimus-eluting 
      stent (EES) (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, California) in patients with de novo 
      lesions. BACKGROUND: Small vessel coronary artery disease (SVD) represents one of 
      the most attractive fields of application for DCB. To date, several devices have 
      been compared with drug-eluting stents in this setting, with different outcomes. 
      METHODS: The PICCOLETO II (Drug Eluting Balloon Efficacy for Small Coronary 
      Vessel Disease Treatment) trial was an international, investigator-driven, 
      multicenter, open-label, prospective randomized controlled trial where patients 
      with de novo SVD lesions were randomized to DCB or EES. Primary study endpoint 
      was in-lesion late lumen loss (LLL) at 6 months (independent core laboratory), 
      with the noninferiority between the 2 arms hypothesized. Secondary endpoints were 
      minimal lumen diameter, percent diameter stenosis at angiographic follow-up, and 
      the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events at 12 months. RESULTS: Between May 
      2015 and May 2018, a total of 232 patients were enrolled at 5 centers. After a 
      median of 189 (interquartile range: 160 to 202) days, in-lesion LLL was 
      significantly lower in the DCB group (0.04 vs. 0.17 mm; p = 0.001 for 
      noninferiority; p = 0.03 for superiority). Percent diameter stenosis and minimal 
      lumen diameter were not significantly different. At 12-month clinical follow-up, 
      major adverse cardiac events occurred in 7.5% of the DES group and in 5.6% of the 
      DCB group (p = 0.55). There was a numerically higher incidence of spontaneous 
      myocardial infarction (4.7% vs. 1.9%; p = 0.23) and vessel thrombosis (1.8% vs. 
      0%; p = 0.15) in the DES arm. CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter randomized 
      clinical trial in patients with de novo SVD lesions, a new-generation DCB was 
      found superior to EES in terms of LLL as the angiographic pattern and comparable 
      in terms of clinical outcome. (Drug Eluting Balloon Efficacy for Small Coronary 
      Vessel Disease Treatment [PICCOLETO II]; NCT03899818).

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) and intracranial 
      arterial stenosis (ICAS) on stroke outcomes remains unclear. METHODS: Data of 
      1045 patients with minor stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) were obtained 
      from 45 sites of the Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients with Acute Non-disabling 
      Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) trial. We assessed the associations of burdens of 
      CSVD and ICAS with new strokes and bleeding events using multivariate Cox 
      regression models and those with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores using ordinal 
      logistic regression models. RESULTS: Among the 1045 patients, CSVD was present in 
      830 cases (79.4%) and ICAS in 460 (44.0%). Patients with >1 ICAS segment showed 
      the highest risk of new strokes (HR 2.03, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.56, p=0.01). No 
      association between CSVD and the occurrence of new strokes was found. The 
      presence of severe CSVD (common OR (cOR) 2.01, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.89, p<0.001) and 
      >1 ICAS segment (cOR 2.15, 95% CI 1.57 to 2.93, p<0.001) was associated with 
      higher mRS scores. Severe CSVD (HR 10.70, 95% CI 1.16 to 99.04, p=0.04), but not 
      ICAS, was associated with a higher risk of bleeding events. Six-point modified 
      CSVD score improved the predictive power for bleeding events and disability. 
      INTERPRETATION: CSVD is associated with more disability and bleeding events, and 
      ICAS is associated with an increased risk of stroke and disability in patients 
      with minor stroke and TIA at 3 months. CSVD and ICAS may represent different 
      vascular pathologies and play distinct roles in stroke outcomes. TRIAL

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the angiographic efficacy and 
      clinical outcomes of the Restore paclitaxel-coated balloon in a randomized trial 
      designed to enable its approval with an indication for small-vessel disease 
      (SVD). BACKGROUND: Higher rates of restenosis and stent thrombosis limit the 
      effectiveness of drug-eluting stent (DES) treatment of SVD. Whether a drug-coated 
      balloon (DCB)-only strategy is effective in de novo SVD is not yet established. 
      METHODS: In the noninferiority RESTORE SVD China trial, eligible patients with 
      reference vessel diameter ≥2.25 and ≤2.75 mm were randomized to the Restore DCB 
      or the RESOLUTE Integrity DES in a 1:1 ratio stratified by diabetes and number of 
      lesions treated. Patients with RVD ≥2.00 and <2.25 mm were enrolled in a nested 
      very small vessel registry. Angiographic and clinical follow-up were planned at 9 
      months and 1 year, respectively, in all patients. The study was powered for the 
      primary endpoint of 9-month in-segment percentage diameter stenosis. RESULTS: 
      Between August 2016 and June 2017, a total of 230 subjects at 12 sites were 
      randomized to the DCB group (n = 116) or DES group (n = 114); 32 patients were 
      treated with the DCB in the very small vessel cohort. Nine-month in-segment 
      percentage diameter stenosis was 29.6 ± 2.0% with the DCB versus 24.1 ± 2.0% with 
      the DES; the 1-sided 97.5% upper confidence limit of the difference was 10.9%, 
      achieving noninferiority of the DCB compared with the DES (p for noninferiority < 
      0.001). The DCB and DES had comparable 1-year rates of target lesion failure 
      (4.4% vs. 2.6%, p = 0.72). CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter randomized trial, the 
      Restore DCB was noninferior to the RESOLUTE DES for 9-month in-segment percentage

AB  - The treatment for large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) stroke is also important for 
      patients with cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). Our aim is to clarify the risk 
      factors for ischemic cerebral SVD and to evaluate the different risk factor 
      profiles of the two ischemic stroke subtypes, namely, ischemic cerebral SVD and 
      LAA. A total of 353 patients with acute ischemic stroke were assigned to two 
      groups according to the Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) 
      criteria: the ischemic cerebral SVD group and the LAA group. A total of 70 
      non-stroke patients admitted during the same period served as the control group. 
      Clinical variables were collected, including age, sex, blood pressure, blood 
      glucose, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol (TC), smoking 
      history, drinking history, coronary atherosclerotic heart disease and family 
      history of a high-risk disease. Multivariate logistic regression (MLR) analyses 
      were performed. MLR analysis showed that risk factors for LAA stroke included 
      hypertension, diabetes mellitus, high low-density lipoprotein, 
      hypertriglyceridemia and smoking compared with the control group. The analysis 
      also showed that the risk factors for cerebral SVD stroke were hypertension, 
      diabetes mellitus, high TC, hypertriglyceridemia and smoking. In terms of the 
      factors distinguishing LAA and cerebral SVD, MLR demonstrated that high TC played 
      prominent roles in cerebral SVD. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, high total 
      cholesterol, hypertriglyceridemia and smoking are independent risk factors for 
      cerebral SVD stroke. Compared with the LAA stroke group, patients with cerebral 
      SVD stroke were more likely to have a high level of TC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug-coated balloons (DCB) are a novel therapeutic strategy for small 
      native coronary artery disease. However, their safety and efficacy is poorly 
      defined in comparison with drug-eluting stents (DES). METHODS: BASKET-SMALL 2 was 
      a multicentre, open-label, randomised non-inferiority trial. 758 patients with 
      de-novo lesions (<3 mm in diameter) in coronary vessels and an indication for 
      percutaneous coronary intervention were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive 
      angioplasty with DCB versus implantation of a second-generation DES after 
      successful predilatation via an interactive internet-based response system. Dual 
      antiplatelet therapy was given according to current guidelines. The primary 
      objective was to show non-inferiority of DCB versus DES regarding major adverse 
      cardiac events (MACE; ie, cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and 
      target-vessel revascularisation) after 12 months. The non-inferiority margin was 
      an absolute difference of 4% in MACE. This trial is registered with 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01574534. FINDINGS: Between April 10, 2012, and 
      February 1, 2017, 382 patients were randomly assigned to the DCB group and 376 to 
      DES group. Non-inferiority of DCB versus DES was shown because the 95% CI of the 
      absolute difference in MACE in the per-protocol population was below the 
      predefined margin (-3·83 to 3·93%, p=0·0217). After 12 months, the proportions of 
      MACE were similar in both groups of the full-analysis population (MACE was 7·5% 
      for the DCB group vs 7·3% for the DES group; hazard ratio [HR] 0·97 [95% CI 
      0·58-1·64], p=0·9180). There were five (1·3%) cardiac-related deaths in the DES 
      group and 12 (3·1%) in the DCB group (full analysis population). Probable or 
      definite stent thrombosis (three [0·8%] in the DCB group vs four [1·1%] in the 
      DES group; HR 0·73 [0·16-3·26]) and major bleeding (four [1·1%] in the DCB group 
      vs nine [2·4%] in the DES group; HR 0·45 [0·14-1·46]) were the most common 
      adverse events. INTERPRETATION: In small native coronary artery disease, DCB was 
      non-inferior to DES regarding MACE up to 12 months, with similar event rates for 
      both treatment groups. FUNDING: Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der

AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug-coated balloons are a safe and effective option for patients 
      undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, but prior randomized studies have 
      exclusively used paclitaxel-coated devices. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was 
      to assess for the first time the safety and efficacy of a novel biolimus-coated 
      balloon (BCB) in patients with small-vessel coronary disease. METHODS: In a 
      prospective trial conducted at 10 centers in China, 212 patients with 
      small-vessel native coronary disease (reference vessel diameter 2.0-2.75 mm, 
      lesion length ≤25 mm) were randomized to receive a BCB or an uncoated balloon. 
      The primary endpoint was in-segment late lumen loss at 9 months. RESULTS: In the 
      per-protocol population, angiographic late lumen loss at 9 months was 0.16 ± 
      0.29 mm in the BCB group vs 0.30 ± 0.35 mm with the plain balloon (P = 0.001). 
      Late luminal enlargement (positive remodeling) occurred in 29.7% of patients in 
      the BCB group vs 9.8% of patients with plain balloons (P = 0.007). In the full 
      analysis set population, after 12 months, target lesion failure rates were 6.7% 
      in the BCB group vs 13.9% with the plain balloon (HR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.19-1.16), 
      and rates of the patient-oriented clinical outcome were 14.3% with the BCB vs 
      21.8% with the plain balloon (HR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.33-1.24). CONCLUSIONS: In this 
      first-in-human study, a novel BCB showed superior efficacy to plain balloon 
      angioplasty in patients with small-vessel coronary disease undergoing 
      percutaneous coronary intervention. Positive vascular remodeling was more 
      frequent, and there was a trend toward improved clinical outcomes. (A Randomized 
      Trial of a Biolimus-Coated Balloon Versus POBA in Small Vessel Coronary Artery

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of the Association of Nimodipine and Choline Alphoscerate in 
      the Treatment of Cognitive Impairment in Patients with Cerebral Small Vessel 
      Disease. The CONIVaD Trial.
PG  - 481-491

AB  - BACKGROUND: No approved treatment is available for patients with vascular 
      cognitive impairment (VCI) due to cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). OBJECTIVE: 
      The CONIVaD (Choline Alphoscerate and Nimodipine in Vascular Dementia) study 
      aimed to investigate the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of a combined 
      treatment with choline alphoscerate and nimodipine in patients with SVD and 
      mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment. METHODS: Within this pilot, single-center 
      (university hospital), double-blinded, randomized clinical trial, patients were 
      randomized to two arms: 1-year treatment with nimodipine 30 mg three times a day 
      (TID) plus choline alphoscerate 600 mg twice a day (BID) (arm 1) or nimodipine 30 
      mg TID plus placebo BID (arm 2). Patients underwent an evaluation at baseline and 
      after 12 months. Cognitive decline, defined as a ≥ 2-point loss on the Montreal 
      Cognitive Assessment, was the primary endpoint. Functional, quality of life, 
      other cognitive measures, and safety were secondary endpoints. Treatment 
      adherence was measured by the count of medicine bottles returned by patients. 
      RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were randomized (31 each arm). Fourteen patients 
      (22%) dropped out for reasons including consent withdrawal (n = 9), adverse 
      reactions (n = 4), and stroke (n = 1). Forty-eight patients (mean ± SD age 75.1 ± 
      6.8 years), well balanced between arms, completed the study. Regarding adherence, 
      of the prescribed total drug dose, > 75% was taken by 96% of patients for choline 
      alphoscerate, 87.5% for placebo, and 15% for nimodipine. No statistically 
      significant differences were found between the treatment groups for the primary 
      cognitive outcome, nor for the secondary outcomes. Eight patients had non-serious 
      adverse reactions; five presented adverse events. CONCLUSION: Patients' adherence 
      to treatment was low. With this limitation, the combined choline 
      alphoscerate-nimodipine treatment showed no significant effect in our cohort of 
      VCI patients with SVD. The safety profile was good overall. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      Clinical Trial NCT03228498. Registered 25 July 2017.

AB  - Cardiac events are commonly triggered by rupture of intracoronary plaque. Many 
      studies have suggested that retinal small vessel abnormalities predict cardiac 
      events. The present study examined retinal microvascular abnormalities associated 
      with intracoronary plaque. This was a single centre cross-sectional observational 
      study of consecutive subjects who underwent coronary angiography and 
      intracoronary optical coherence tomography (OCT) of occlusive coronary artery 
      disease. Subjects' retinal images were deidentified and graded for microvascular 
      retinopathy (Wong and Mitchell classification), and vessel calibre using a 
      semiautomated method based on Knudtson's modification of the Parr Hubbard 
      formula. Control subjects had no significant plaque on angiography. Analysis used 
      the Fisher's exact test or student t-test. Thirty-two subjects with intracoronary 
      plaque including 22 males (79%) had a mean age of 62.6 ± 9.4 years. Twenty-four 
      (86%) had hypertension, 10 (36%) had diabetes, and 21 (75%) were current or 
      former smokers. Their average mean arterial pressure was 90.5 ± 5.8 mm Hg, and 
      mean eGFR was 74 ± 15/min/1.73 m(2). On angiography, 23 (82%) had a left anterior 
      descending artery (LAD) stenosis, their mean diseased vessel score was 
      1.86 ± 1.21, and mean total stent number was 1.04 ± 1.00. Plaque type was mainly 
      (>50%) fibrous (n = 7), lipid (n = 7), calcific (n = 10), or mixed (n = 4). 
      Control subjects had a lower mean diastolic BP (p = 0.01), were less likely to 
      have an LAD stenosis (p < 0.001), a lower mean diseased vessel score (p < 0.001) 
      and fewer stents (p = 0.02). Subjects with plaque were more likely to have a 
      moderate microvascular retinopathy than those with none (p = 0.004). Moderate 
      retinopathy was more common with lipid (p = 0.05) or calcific (p = 0.003) plaque. 
      Individuals with calcific plaque had a larger arteriole calibre (158.4 ± 15.2 µm) 
      than those with no plaque (143.8 ± 10.6 µm, p = 0.02), but calibre was not 
      related to diabetes or smoking. Calibre did not correlate with plaque length, 
      thickness or arc angle. Thus, subjects with intracoronary artery plaque are more 
      likely to have a moderate microvascular retinopathy. Those with calcific plaque 
      have larger retinal arterioles which is consistent with our previous finding of 
      larger vessel calibre in triple coronary artery disease. Retinal microvascular 
      imaging warrants further evaluation in identifying severe coronary artery 
      disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Data are lacking on the comparative effectiveness of commonly used 
      glucose-lowering medications, when added to metformin, with respect to 
      microvascular and cardiovascular disease outcomes in persons with type 2 
      diabetes. METHODS: We assessed the comparative effectiveness of four commonly 
      used glucose-lowering medications, added to metformin, in achieving and 
      maintaining a glycated hemoglobin level of less than 7.0% in participants with 
      type 2 diabetes. The randomly assigned therapies were insulin glargine U-100 
      (hereafter, glargine), glimepiride, liraglutide, and sitagliptin. Prespecified 
      secondary outcomes with respect to microvascular and cardiovascular disease 
      included hypertension and dyslipidemia, confirmed moderately or severely 
      increased albuminuria or an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 
      ml per minute per 1.73 m(2) of body-surface area, diabetic peripheral neuropathy 
      assessed with the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument, cardiovascular events 
      (major adverse cardiovascular events [MACE], hospitalization for heart failure, 
      or an aggregate outcome of any cardiovascular event), and death. Hazard ratios 
      are presented with 95% confidence limits that are not adjusted for multiple 
      comparisons. RESULTS: During a mean 5.0 years of follow-up in 5047 participants, 
      there were no material differences among the interventions with respect to the 
      development of hypertension or dyslipidemia or with respect to microvascular 
      outcomes; the mean overall rate (i.e., events per 100 participant-years) of 
      moderately increased albuminuria levels was 2.6, of severely increased 
      albuminuria levels 1.1, of renal impairment 2.9, and of diabetic peripheral 
      neuropathy 16.7. The treatment groups did not differ with respect to MACE 
      (overall rate, 1.0), hospitalization for heart failure (0.4), death from 
      cardiovascular causes (0.3), or all deaths (0.6). There were small differences 
      with respect to rates of any cardiovascular disease, with 1.9, 1.9, 1.4, and 2.0 
      in the glargine, glimepiride, liraglutide, and sitagliptin groups, respectively. 
      When one treatment was compared with the combined results of the other three 
      treatments, the hazard ratios for any cardiovascular disease were 1.1 (95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 0.9 to 1.3) in the glargine group, 1.1 (95% CI, 0.9 to 
      1.4) in the glimepiride group, 0.7 (95% CI, 0.6 to 0.9) in the liraglutide group, 
      and 1.2 (95% CI, 1.0 to 1.5) in the sitagliptin group. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      participants with type 2 diabetes, the incidences of microvascular complications 
      and death were not materially different among the four treatment groups. The 
      findings indicated possible differences among the groups in the incidence of any 
      cardiovascular disease. (Funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and

TI  - Silent Cerebral Small Vessel Disease in Restless Legs Syndrome.
PG  - 1371-7
LID - 10.5665/sleep.5966 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Growing literature suggests that patients with restless legs 
      syndrome (RLS) may be at increased risk for hypertension, heart disease, and 
      stroke. Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is a known risk factor for clinical 
      stroke. This study evaluated silent cerebral SVD by MRI in patients with RLS, in 
      the absence of a history of previous clinical stroke or known stroke risk factors 
      and taking into account disease duration. METHODS: Fifty-three patients with RLS 
      < 10 y were prospectively recruited along with 44 with RLS > 10 y and 74 normal 
      controls. A magnetic resonance imaging study was obtained from all subjects and 
      scans were analyzed for area and volume of SVD. RESULTS: There was a significant 
      increase in SVD area in the entire group of RLS patients compared to controls (P 
      = 0.036); this was almost entirely driven by the group with RLS > 10 y. SVD area 
      and volume were significantly increased in patients with RLS > 10 y with respect 
      to both controls (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.0014, respectively) and RLS < 10 y (P < 
      0.00022 and P < 0.003, respectively). Age, duration of RLS, and the interaction 
      of age and duration of RLS were independent predictors of SVD disease. Duration 
      of RLS was an independent predictor of the burden of cerebral SVD (area P < 
      0.00012 and volume P < 0.0025), whereas sex and insomnia were not. CONCLUSION: 
      RLS duration should be taken into account when analyzing the association between 
      RLS and cerebrovascular disease; our data support the hypothesis that a 
      long-lasting RLS and its accompanying periodic limb movements in sleep are a risk 
      factor for silent SVD and perhaps for the development of clinical stroke.

TI  - Cerebral Small Vessel, But Not Large Vessel Disease, Is Associated With Impaired 
      Cerebral Autoregulation During Cardiopulmonary Bypass: A Retrospective Cohort 
      Study.
PG  - 1314-1322
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0000000000003384 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Impaired cerebral blood flow (CBF) autoregulation during 
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is associated with stroke and other adverse 
      outcomes. Large and small arterial stenosis is prevalent in patients undergoing 
      cardiac surgery. We hypothesize that large and/or small vessel cerebral arterial 
      disease is associated with impaired cerebral autoregulation during CPB. METHODS: 
      A retrospective cohort analysis of data from 346 patients undergoing cardiac 
      surgery with CPB enrolled in an ongoing prospectively randomized clinical trial 
      of autoregulation monitoring were evaluated. The study protocol included 
      preoperative transcranial Doppler (TCD) evaluation of major cerebral artery flow 
      velocity by a trained vascular technician and brain magnetic resonance imaging 
      (MRI) between postoperative days 3 and 5. Brain MRI images were evaluated for 
      chronic white matter hyperintensities (WMHI) by a vascular neurologist blinded to 
      autoregulation data. "Large vessel" cerebral vascular disease was defined by the 
      presence of characteristic TCD changes associated with stenosis of the major 
      cerebral arteries. "Small vessel" cerebral vascular disease was defined based on 
      accepted scoring methods of WMHI. All patients had continuous TCD-based 
      autoregulation monitoring during surgery. RESULTS: Impaired autoregulation 
      occurred in 32.4% (112/346) of patients. Preoperative TCD demonstrated 
      moderate-severe large vessel stenosis in 67 (25.2%) of 266 patients with complete 
      data. In adjusted analysis, female sex (odds ratio [OR], 0.46; 95% confidence 
      interval [CI], 0.25-0.86; P = .014) and higher average temperature during CPB 
      (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.02-1.475; P = .029), but not moderate-severe large cerebral 
      arterial stenosis (P = .406), were associated with impaired autoregulation during 
      CPB. Of the 119 patients with available brain MRI data, 42 (35.3%) demonstrated 
      WMHI. The presence of small vessel cerebral vascular disease was associated with 
      impaired CBF autoregulation (OR, 3.25; 95% CI, 1.21-8.71; P = .019) after 
      adjustment for age, history of peripheral vascular disease, preoperative 
      hemoglobin level, and preoperative treatment with calcium channel blocking drugs. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm that impaired CBF autoregulation is prevalent 
      during CPB predisposing affected patients to brain hypoperfusion or 
      hyperperfusion with low or high blood pressure, respectively. Small vessel, but 
      not large vessel, cerebral vascular disease, male sex, and higher average body 
      temperature during CPB appear to be associated with impaired autoregulation.

TI  - Assessing cortical cerebral microinfarcts on iron-sensitive MRI in cerebral small 
      vessel disease.
PG  - 3391-3399

AB  - Recent studies suggest that a subset of cortical microinfarcts may be 
      identifiable on T2* but invisible on T1 and T2 follow-up images. We aimed to 
      investigate whether cortical microinfarcts are associated with iron accumulation 
      after the acute stage. The RUN DMC - InTENse study is a serial MRI study 
      including individuals with cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). 54 Participants 
      underwent 10 monthly 3 T MRIs, including diffusion-weighted imaging, quantitative 
      R1 (=1/T1), R2 (=1/T2), and R2* (=1/T2*) mapping, from which MRI parameters 
      within areas corresponding to microinfarcts and control region of interests 
      (ROIs) were retrieved within 16 participants. Finally, we compared pre- and 
      post-lesional values with repeated measures ANOVA and post-hoc paired t-tests 
      using the mean difference between lesion and control ROI values. We observed 21 
      acute cortical microinfarcts in 7 of the 54 participants (median age 69 years 
      [IQR 66-74], 63% male). R2* maps demonstrated an increase in R2* values at the 
      moment of the last available follow-up MRI (median [IQR], 5 [5-14] weeks after 
      infarction) relative to prelesional values (p = .08), indicative of iron 
      accumulation. Our data suggest that cortical microinfarcts are associated with 
      increased R2* values, indicative of iron accumulation, possibly due to 
      microhemorrhages, neuroinflammation or neurodegeneration, awaiting 
      histopathological verification.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) associated with age and vascular 
      risk factors is one of the leading causes of cognitive disorders as well as 
      ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. The pathogenesis of this disease has not been 
      fully understood yet. The previously established association of the antibodies 
      against the NR2 subunit of the NMDA receptor (NR2ab) with the mechanisms of SVD 
      such as ischemia and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, might suggest their 
      importance in the brain damage. DESIGN & METHODS: We studied the NR2ab serum 
      level in 70 patients (45 females, 61.1 ± 6.3 y.o.) with different severity of 
      cognitive impairment and MRI features of SVD and 20 healthy volunteers (12 
      females, 58.5 ± 6.4 y.o.). RESULTS: The elevated level of NR2ab was associated 
      with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) (p = 0.028) and mild cognitive 
      impairment (MCI) (p = 0.017), Fazekas grade (F) 2 (p = 0,002) and F3 (p = 0,009) 
      of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and the numbers of lacunes in the cerebral 
      white matter (less than 5) (p = 0,039). CONCLUSION: The detected increase in 
      serum NR2ab level in patients with SCI, as well as the minimal amount of white 
      matter lacunes, is most likely caused by hypoxia-induced endothelial damage in 
      the early stage of SVD. Normal NR2ab values in patients with F1 WMH, the 
      increased NR2ab level in patients with F2 and F3 WMH and those with the minimal 
      number of lacunes can indicate that NR2bs are involved in diffuse brain damage 
      due to hypoxia-induced loss of BBB integrity.

TI  - Common NOTCH3 Variants and Cerebral Small-Vessel Disease.
PG  - 1482-7
LID - 10.1161/STROKEAHA.114.008540 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The most common monogenic cause of cerebral small-vessel 
      disease is cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and 
      leukoencephalopathy, caused by NOTCH3 gene mutations. It has been hypothesized 
      that more common variants in NOTCH3 may also contribute to the risk of sporadic 
      small-vessel disease. Previously, 4 common variants (rs10404382, rs1043994, 
      rs10423702, and rs1043997) were found to be associated with the presence of white 
      matter hyperintensity in hypertensive community-dwelling elderly. METHODS: We 
      investigated the association of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 
      NOTCH3 in 1350 patients with MRI-confirmed lacunar stroke and 7397 controls, by 
      meta-analysis of genome-wide association study data sets. In addition, we 
      investigated the association of common SNPs in NOTCH3 with MRI white matter 
      hyperintensity volumes in 3670 white patients with ischemic stroke. In each 
      analysis, we considered all SNPs within the NOTCH3 gene, and within 50-kb 
      upstream and downstream of the coding region. A total of 381 SNPs from the 1000 
      genome population with a mean allele frequency>0.01 were included in the 
      analysis. A significance level of P<0.0015 was used, adjusted for the effective 
      number of independent SNPs in the region using the Galwey method. RESULTS: We 
      found no association of any common variants in NOTCH3 (including rs10404382, 
      rs1043994, rs10423702, and rs1043997) with lacunar stroke or white matter 
      hyperintensity volume. We repeated our analysis stratified for hypertension but 
      again found no association. CONCLUSIONS: Our study does not support a role for 
      common NOTCH3 variation in the risk of sporadic small-vessel disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The significance of structural changes associated with 
      cerebral small-vessel disease (SVD), including white matter lesions (WML), 
      lacunes, and brain atrophy, to outcome from acute intracerebral hemorrhage is 
      uncertain. We determined associations of computed tomographic radiological 
      manifestations of cerebral SVD and outcomes, and in terms of any differential 
      effect of early intensive blood pressure-lowering treatment, in the large-scale 
      Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trial 
      (INTERACT2). METHODS: We graded WML (van Swieten scale), the presence of lacunes, 
      and brain atrophy (2 linear measurements and visual rating) for 2069 of 2839 
      patients with available baseline brain computed tomography (<6 hours of 
      intracerebral hemorrhage onset) by 3 independent neurologists blind to clinical 
      data. RESULTS: WML grade and 2 linear measurements of brain atrophy were 
      associated with death or major disability at 90 days: multivariable-adjusted odds 
      ratios for WML (grade 3 and 4 versus 0), frontal ratio, and third ventricle 
      Sylvian fissure distance (most versus least severe atrophy quartile) were 1.42 
      (95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.98), 1.47 (1.08-1.99), and 1.64 (1.21-2.22), 
      respectively (all P for trend <0.05). There was no association between lacunes 
      and outcomes. There were no significant differences in the effects of intensive 
      blood pressure-lowering across subgroups of cerebral SVD. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Preexisting cerebral SVD manifestations of WML and brain atrophy predict poor 
      outcome in acute intracerebral hemorrhage. There is no apparent hazard of early 
      intensive lowering of blood pressure according to the INTERACT2 protocol, in 
      patients with underlying cerebral SVD. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL:

TI  - Association of Blood Pressure Lowering Intensity With White Matter Network 
      Integrity in Patients With Cerebral Small Vessel Disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) networks integrate 
      damage from a variety of pathologic processes in cerebral small vessel disease 
      (SVD) and may be a sensitive marker to detect treatment effects. We determined 
      whether brain network analysis could detect treatment effects in the PRESERVE 
      trial data set, in which intensive vs standard blood pressure (BP) lowering was 
      compared. The primary end point of DTI had not shown treatment differences. 
      METHODS: Participants with lacunar stroke were randomized to standard (systolic 
      130-140 mm Hg) or intensive (systolic ≤ 125 mm Hg) BP lowering and followed for 2 
      years with MRI at baseline and at 2 years. Graph theory-based metrics were 
      derived from DTI data to produce a measure of network integrity weighted global 
      efficiency and compared with individual MRI markers of DTI, brain volume, and 
      white matter hyperintensities. RESULTS: Data were available in 82 subjects: 
      standard n = 40 (mean age 66.3 ± 1.5 years) and intensive n = 42 (mean age 69.6 ± 
      1.0 years). The mean (SD) systolic BP was reduced by 13(14) and 23(23) mm Hg in 
      the standard and intensive groups, respectively (p < 0.001 between groups). 
      Significant differences in diffusion network metrics were found, with improved 
      network integrity (weighted global efficiency, p = 0.002) seen with intensive BP 
      lowering. In contrast, there were no significant differences in individual MRI 
      markers including DTI histogram metrics, brain volume, or white matter 
      hyperintensities. DISCUSSION: Brain network analysis may be a sensitive surrogate 
      marker in trials in SVD. This work suggests that measures of brain network 
      efficiency may be more sensitive to the effects of BP control treatment than 
      conventional DTI metrics. TRIAL REGISTRATION INFORMATION: The trial is registered 
      with the ISRCTN Registry (ISRCTN37694103; doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN37694103) and the 
      NIHR Clinical Research Network (CRN 10962; 
      public-odp.nihr.ac.uk/QvAJAXZfc/opendoc.htm?document=crncc_users%5Cfind%20a%20clinical%20research%20study.qvw&lang=en-US&host=QVS%40crn-prod-odp-pu&anonymous=true). 
      CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that intensive 
      BP lowering in patients with SVD results in improved brain network function when 
      assessed by DTI-based brain network metrics.

TI  - Plasma exchange and glucocorticoid dosing in the treatment of anti-neutrophil 
      cytoplasm antibody associated vasculitis (PEXIVAS): protocol for a randomized 
      controlled trial.
PG  - 73
LID - 10.1186/1745-6215-14-73 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, Wegener's) and microscopic 
      polyangiitis (MPA) are small vessel vasculitides collectively referred to as 
      anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV). AAV is associated 
      with high rates of morbidity and mortality due to uncontrolled disease and 
      treatment toxicity. Small randomized trials suggest adjunctive plasma exchange 
      may improve disease control, while observational evidence suggests that current 
      oral glucocorticoid doses are associated with severe infections in patients with 
      AAV. A randomized study of both plasma exchange and glucocorticoids is required 
      to evaluate plasma exchange and oral glucocorticoid dosing in patients with AAV. 
      METHODS/DESIGN: PEXIVAS is a two-by-two factorial randomized trial evaluating 
      adjunctive plasma exchange and two oral glucocorticoid regimens in severe AAV. 
      Five hundred patients are being randomized at centers across Europe, North 
      America, Asia, and Australasia to receive plasma exchange or no plasma exchange, 
      and to receive standard or reduced oral glucocorticoid dosing. All patients 
      receive immunosuppression with either cyclophosphamide or rituximab. The primary 
      outcome is the time to the composite of all-cause mortality and end-stage renal 
      disease.PEXIVAS is funded by the National Institute of Health Research (UK), the 
      Food and Drug Administration (USA), the National Institutes of Health (USA), the 
      Canadian Institute of Health Research (Canada), the National Health and Medical 
      Research Council (Australia), and Assistance Publique (France). Additional 
      in-kind supplies for plasma exchange are provided by industry partners 
      (TerumoBCT, Gambro Australia, and Fresenius Australia). DISCUSSION: This is the 
      largest trial in AAV undertaken to date. PEXIVAS will inform the future standard 
      of care for patients with severe AAV. The cooperation between investigators, 
      funding agencies, and industry provides a model for conducting studies in rare 
      diseases. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials: (ISRCTN07757494) and 
      clinicaltrials.gov: (NCT00987389).

TI  - Behavioural and psychological symptoms in vascular dementia; differences between 
      small- and large-vessel disease.
PG  - 547-51
LID - 10.1136/jnnp.2009.187500 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The authors investigated the prevalence of behavioural and psychological 
      symptoms in vascular dementia (VaD) from baseline data of the VantagE study and 
      compared the severity and relative frequency of symptoms between small-vessel VaD 
      and large-vessel VaD. METHODS: Behavioural and psychological symptoms of 484 VaD 
      patients included in a large multicentre clinical trial (registration number 
      NCT00099216) were determined using the 12-item Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). 
      Symptoms were considered present when the score was > or =1. Based on MRI, 
      patients were classified as having small-vessel VaD (83%) or large-vessel VaD 
      (17%). RESULTS: Behavioural and psychological symptoms were reported in 92% of 
      the VaD patients. The median NPI score of the total study population was 9 
      (0-76), with a median number of three symptoms per patient. Apathy (65%) was most 
      prevalent, followed by depressive symptoms (45%), irritability (42%) and 
      agitation/aggression (40%). Patients with small-vessel VaD reported more apathy, 
      aberrant motor behaviour and hallucinations than patients with large-vessel VaD 
      (p<0.05). In contrast, patients with large-vessel VaD reported a higher severity 
      of agitation/aggression and euphoria (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Behavioural and 
      psychological symptoms are common in VaD. Patients with small-vessel and 
      large-vessel VaD demonstrate different profiles of symptoms, with especially more 
      apathy in small-vessel VaD and more agitation/agression in large-vessel VaD.

TI  - Clinical outcomes in real-world patients with small vessel disease treated with 
      XIENCE V® everolimus-eluting stents: one year results from the XIENCE V® USA 
      condition of approval post-market study.
PG  - 7-16
LID - 10.1002/ccd.25325 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 1-year clinical 
      outcomes of more complex XIENCE V USA real-world patients with small versus 
      nonsmall vessel lesions. BACKGROUND: Patients with small vessel lesions 
      undergoing coronary stent placement are at higher risk of major adverse cardiac 
      events. Improved safety and efficacy of XIENCE V everolimus eluting stents (EES) 
      have been previously demonstrated in selected low-risk small vessel populations 
      in randomized clinical trials. METHODS: The XIENCE V USA study was a condition of 
      approval, single-arm study in unselected real-world patients. Baseline and 1-year 
      clinical outcomes were compared between XIENCE V USA patients who received a 
      single 2.5 mm stent (small vessel group, N = 838) and patients implanted with a 
      single >2.5 mm stent (non-small vessel group, N = 2,015). Mean reference vessel 
      diameter was 2.55 ± 0.36 and 3.25 ± 0.46 mm in the small and non-small vessel 
      groups, respectively (P < 0.001). RESULTS: Small vessel group had more females, 
      presented with a higher rate of diabetes, and had more complex lesion 
      characteristics. The definite or probable ST rates analyzed using Kaplan-Meier 
      method were low and not significantly different between the groups at 0.37 and 
      0.40% for the small and nonsmall vessel group (P = 0.88), respectively. The 
      composite rate of cardiac death or MI was comparable at 4.5% for the small and 
      5.1% for the non-small vessel 1 groups (P = 0.57). The 1-year target lesion 
      revascularization rate was also comparable in the small vessel group (3.8% vs. 
      3.0%, P = 0.35). CONCLUSIONS: Despite gender difference, higher prevalence of 
      diabetes and more complex lesions in the small vessel groups, the 1-year clinical 
      outcomes were similar in both small and nonsmall vessel groups. These results 
      demonstrate the therapeutic benefit of XIENCE V EES in a real-world all inclusive 
      patient population with small vessel disease.

TI  - Remote Ischemic Conditioning May Improve Outcomes of Patients With Cerebral 
      Small-Vessel Disease.
PG  - 3064-3072
LID - 10.1161/STROKEAHA.117.017691 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of remote ischemic 
      conditioning (RIC) in patients with cerebral small-vessel disease. METHODS: 
      Thirty patients with cerebral small-vessel disease-related mild cognitive 
      impairment were enrolled in this prospective, randomized controlled study for 1 
      year. Besides routine medical treatment, participants were randomized into the 
      experimental group (n=14) undergoing 5 cycles consisting of ischemia followed by 
      reperfusion for 5 minutes on both upper limbs twice daily for 1 year or the 
      control group (n=16) who were treated with sham ischemia-reperfusion cycles. The 
      primary outcome was the change of brain lesions, and secondary outcomes were 
      changes of cognitive function, plasma biomarkers, and cerebral hemodynamic 
      parameters both at baseline and at the end of 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: Compared 
      with pretreatment, the post-treatment white matter hyperintensities volume in the 
      RIC group was significantly reduced (9.10±7.42 versus 6.46±6.05 cm(3); P=0.020), 
      whereas no significant difference was observed in the sham-RIC group (8.99±6.81 
      versus 8.07±6.56 cm(3); P=0.085). The reduction of white matter hyperintensities 
      volume in the RIC group was more substantial than that in sham group (-2.632 
      versus -0.935 cm(3); P=0.049). No significant difference was found in the change 
      of the number of lacunes between 2 groups (0 versus 0; P=0.694). A significant 
      treatment difference at 1 year on visuospatial and executive ability was found 
      between the 2 groups (0.639 versus 0.191; P=0.048). RIC showed greater effects 
      compared with sham-RIC on plasma triglyceride (-0.433 versus 0.236 mmol/L; 
      P=0.005), total cholesterol (-0.975 versus 0.134 mmol/L; P<0.001), low-density 
      lipoprotein (-0.645 versus -0.029 mmol/L; P=0.034), and homocysteine (-4.737 
      versus -1.679 µmol/L; P=0.044). Changes of the pulsation indices of middle 
      cerebral arteries from the baseline to 1 year were different between the 2 groups 
      (right: -0.075 versus 0.043; P=0.030; left: -0.085 versus 0.043; P=0.010). 
      CONCLUSIONS: RIC seems to be potentially effective in patients with cerebral 
      small-vessel disease in slowing cognition decline and reducing white matter 
      hyperintensities. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL:

TI  - Long-Term Effect of Ultrathin-Strut Versus Thin-Strut Drug-Eluting Stents in 
      Patients With Small Vessel Coronary Artery Disease Undergoing Percutaneous 
      Coronary Intervention: A Subgroup Analysis of the BIOSCIENCE Randomized Trial.

LID - 10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.119.008024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Randomized trials evaluating the Orsiro biodegradable polymer 
      sirolimus-eluting stent (BP-SES; 60 and 80 μm strut thickness for stent diameters 
      ≤3 and >3 mm, respectively) did not stratify according to vessel size and failed 
      to specify the impact of ultrathin-strut thickness on long-term clinical outcomes 
      compared with durable polymer everolimus-eluting stents (DP-EES). We sought to 
      assess the long-term effect of ultrathin-strut (60 μm) BP-SES versus thin-strut 
      (81 μm) DP-EES on long-term outcomes in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary 
      revascularization for small vessel disease. METHODS: In a subgroup analysis of 
      the randomized, multicenter, noninferiority BIOSCIENCE trial, patients with 
      stable coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndrome randomly assigned to 
      treatment with BP-SES or DP-EES were stratified according to vessel size (≤3 mm 
      versus >3 mm) as a surrogate to compare patients treated with ultrathin-strut 
      versus thin-strut drug-eluting stent. The primary end point was target lesion 
      failure, a composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, and 
      clinically indicated target lesion revascularization, within 5 years. RESULTS: 
      Among 2109 patients, 1234 (59%) were treated for small vessel disease. At 5 
      years, target lesion failure occurred in 124 patients (cumulative incidence, 
      22.3%) treated with ultrathin-strut BP-SES and 109 patients (18.3%) treated with 
      thin-strut DP-EES (rate ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.94-1.58; P=0.13). Cumulative 
      incidences of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, and clinically 
      indicated target lesion revascularization and definite stent thrombosis at 5 
      years were similar in patients treated with ultrathin-strut BP-SES and thin-strut 
      DP-EES. After adjustment for potential confounders, there was no significant 
      interaction between vessel size and treatment effect of BP-SES versus DP-EES. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We found no significant difference in clinical outcomes throughout 5 
      years between patients with small vessel disease treated with ultrathin-strut 
      BP-SES versus thin-strut DP-EES. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL:

TI  - A prospective natural-history study of coronary atherosclerosis.
PG  - 226-35
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa1002358 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic plaques that lead to acute coronary syndromes often 
      occur at sites of angiographically mild coronary-artery stenosis. Lesion-related 
      risk factors for such events are poorly understood. METHODS: In a prospective 
      study, 697 patients with acute coronary syndromes underwent three-vessel coronary 
      angiography and gray-scale and radiofrequency intravascular ultrasonographic 
      imaging after percutaneous coronary intervention. Subsequent major adverse 
      cardiovascular events (death from cardiac causes, cardiac arrest, myocardial 
      infarction, or rehospitalization due to unstable or progressive angina) were 
      adjudicated to be related to either originally treated (culprit) lesions or 
      untreated (nonculprit) lesions. The median follow-up period was 3.4 years. 
      RESULTS: The 3-year cumulative rate of major adverse cardiovascular events was 
      20.4%. Events were adjudicated to be related to culprit lesions in 12.9% of 
      patients and to nonculprit lesions in 11.6%. Most nonculprit lesions responsible 
      for follow-up events were angiographically mild at baseline (mean [±SD] diameter 
      stenosis, 32.3±20.6%). However, on multivariate analysis, nonculprit lesions 
      associated with recurrent events were more likely than those not associated with 
      recurrent events to be characterized by a plaque burden of 70% or greater (hazard 
      ratio, 5.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.51 to 10.11; P<0.001) or a minimal 
      luminal area of 4.0 mm(2) or less (hazard ratio, 3.21; 95% CI, 1.61 to 6.42; 
      P=0.001) or to be classified on the basis of radiofrequency intravascular 
      ultrasonography as thin-cap fibroatheromas (hazard ratio, 3.35; 95% CI, 1.77 to 
      6.36; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients who presented with an acute coronary 
      syndrome and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention, major adverse 
      cardiovascular events occurring during follow-up were equally attributable to 
      recurrence at the site of culprit lesions and to nonculprit lesions. Although 
      nonculprit lesions that were responsible for unanticipated events were frequently 
      angiographically mild, most were thin-cap fibroatheromas or were characterized by 
      a large plaque burden, a small luminal area, or some combination of these 
      characteristics, as determined by gray-scale and radiofrequency intravascular 
      ultrasonography. (Funded by Abbott Vascular and Volcano; ClinicalTrials.gov

TI  - In Vivo Imaging of Venous Side Cerebral Small-Vessel Disease in Older Adults: An 
      MRI Method at 7T.
PG  - 1923-1928
LID - 10.3174/ajnr.A5327 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Traditional neuroimaging markers of small-vessel disease 
      focus on late-stage changes. We aimed to adapt a method of venular assessment at 
      7T for use in older adults. We hypothesized that poorer venular morphologic 
      characteristics would be related to other small-vessel disease neuroimaging 
      markers and a higher prevalence of small-vessel disease-Alzheimer disease risk 
      factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Venules were identified in periventricular ROIs 
      on SWI and defined as tortuous or straight. The tortuosity ratio was defined as 
      total tortuous venular length divided by total straight venular length. White 
      matter hyperintensity burden (visually rated from 0 to 3) and the number of 
      microbleeds (0, 1, >1) were determined. Differences in tortuous and straight 
      venular lengths were evaluated. Relationships with demographic variables, allele 
      producing the e4 type of apolipoprotein E (APOE4), growth factors, pulse 
      pressure, physical activity, and Modified Mini-Mental State Examination were 
      assessed via Spearman correlations. RESULTS: Participants had 42% more tortuous 
      venular tissue than straight (median, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.13-1.62). APOE4 presence 
      was associated with a greater tortuosity ratio (ρ = 0.454, P = .001), and these 
      results were robust to adjustment for confounders and multiple comparisons. 
      Associations of the tortuosity ratio with sex and vascular endothelial growth 
      factor did not survive adjustment. Associations of the tortuosity ratio with 
      other variables of interest were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Morphologic 
      measures of venules at 7T could be useful biomarkers of the early stages of 
      small-vessel disease and Alzheimer disease. Longitudinal studies should examine 
      the impact of apolipoprotein E and vascular endothelial growth factor on the risk 
      of venular damage.

AB  - Research has suggested that the retinal vasculature may act as a surrogate marker 
      for diseased cerebral vessels. Retinal vascular parameters were measured using 
      Vessel Assessment and Measurement Platform for Images of the Retina (VAMPIRE) 
      software in two cohorts: (i) community-dwelling older subjects of the Lothian 
      Birth Cohort 1936 (n = 603); and (ii) patients with recent minor ischaemic stroke 
      of the Mild Stroke Study (n = 155). Imaging markers of small vessel disease (SVD) 
      (white matter hyperintensities [WMH] on structural MRI, visual scores and volume; 
      perivascular spaces; lacunes and microbleeds), and vascular risk measures were 
      assessed in both cohorts. We assessed associations between retinal and brain 
      measurements using structural equation modelling and regression analysis. In the 
      Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 arteriolar fractal dimension accounted for 4% of the 
      variance in WMH load. In the Mild Stroke Study lower arteriolar fractal dimension 
      was associated with deep WMH scores (odds ratio [OR] 0.53; 95% CI, 0.32-0.87). No 
      other retinal measure was associated with SVD. Reduced fractal dimension, a 
      measure of vascular complexity, is related to SVD imaging features in older 
      people. The results provide some support for the use of the retinal vasculature 
      in the study of brain microvascular disease.

TI  - Two-year follow-up of a randomized multicenter study comparing a drug-coated 
      balloon with a drug-eluting stent in native small coronary vessels: The RESTORE 
      Small Vessel Disease China trial.
PG  - 587-597
LID - 10.1002/ccd.28705 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To report the clinical outcomes of the RESTORE drug-coated balloon 
      (DCB; Cardionovum, Bonn, Germany) for treatment of de novo small vessel disease 
      (SVD) beyond 1 year. BACKGROUND: Previous reports have demonstrated the 
      noninferiority of the RESTORE DCB to the RESOLUTE Integrity drug-eluting stent 
      (DES; Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota) in terms of 9-month in-segment percent 
      diameter stenosis. METHODS: In the prospective, multicenter, noninferiority 
      RESTORE SVD China trial, 230 patients with visually-estimated reference vessel 
      diameter (RVD) ≥2.25 and ≤2.75 mm were randomized to DCB or DES in a 1:1 ratio 
      stratified by diabetes and number of lesions treated. Furthermore, 32 patients 
      with RVD ≥2.00 and <2.25 mm were enrolled in a nested very small vessel (VSV) 
      registry. Clinical follow-up were performed at 2 years to evaluate target lesion 
      failure (TLF) in both groups and the VSV cohort. RESULTS: Overall, 256 (97.7%) 
      patients (115 and 109 in the DCB and DES groups, respectively, and 32 in the VSV 
      cohort) completed 2 years of follow-up. There was no significant difference in 
      TLF between the DCB and DES groups (5.2 vs. 3.7%, p = .75). Target lesion 
      revascularization was acceptable at 1 month, 1 year, and 2 years, and did not 
      differ significantly with DCB from that in the DES group (0.9 vs. 0%, p = 1.0, 
      4.4 vs. 2.6%, p = .72, 5.2 vs. 2.8%, p = .50, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Compared to the second-generation DES, the RESTORE DCB did not increase the risk 
      of clinical outcomes. Late catch-up phenomen requiring revascularization was not 
      significant in this study.

TI  - Lacunar Infarcts, but Not Perivascular Spaces, Are Predictors of Cognitive 
      Decline in Cerebral Small-Vessel Disease.
PG  - 586-593
LID - 10.1161/STROKEAHA.117.017526 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral small-vessel disease is a major cause of 
      cognitive impairment. Perivascular spaces (PvS) occur in small-vessel disease, 
      but their relationship to cognitive impairment remains uncertain. One reason may 
      be difficulty in distinguishing between lacunes and PvS. We determined the 
      relationship between baseline PvS score and PvS volume with change in cognition 
      over a 5-year follow-up. We compared this to the relationship between baseline 
      lacune count and total lacune volume with cognition. In addition, we examined 
      change in PvS volume over time. METHODS: Data from the prospective SCANS study 
      (St Georges Cognition and Neuroimaging in Stroke) of patients with symptomatic 
      lacunar stroke and confluent leukoaraiosis were used (n=121). Multimodal magnetic 
      resonance imaging was performed annually for 3 years and neuropsychological 
      testing annually for 5 years. Lacunes were manually identified and distinguished 
      from PvS. PvS were rated using a validated visual rating scale, and PvS volumes 
      calculated using T1-weighted images. Linear mixed-effect models were used to 
      determine the impact of PvS and lacunes on cognition. RESULTS: Baseline PvS 
      scores or volumes showed no association with cognitive indices. No change was 
      detectable in PvS volumes over the 3 years. In contrast, baseline lacunes 
      associated with all cognitive indices and predicted cognitive decline over the 
      5-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Although a feature of small-vessel disease, PvS 
      are not a predictor of cognitive decline, in contrast to lacunes. This study 
      highlights the importance of carefully differentiating between lacunes and PvS in 
      studies investigating vascular cognitive impairment.

TI  - Efficacy of intravitreal bevacizumab for stage 3+ retinopathy of prematurity.
PG  - 603-15
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa1007374 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Retinopathy of prematurity is a leading cause of childhood blindness 
      worldwide. Peripheral retinal ablation with conventional (confluent) laser 
      therapy is destructive, causes complications, and does not prevent all vision 
      loss, especially in cases of retinopathy of prematurity affecting zone I of the 
      eye. Case series in which patients were treated with vascular endothelial growth 
      factor inhibitors suggest that these agents may be useful in treating retinopathy 
      of prematurity. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, controlled, randomized, 
      stratified, multicenter trial to assess intravitreal bevacizumab monotherapy for 
      zone I or zone II posterior stage 3+ (i.e., stage 3 with plus disease) 
      retinopathy of prematurity. Infants were randomly assigned to receive 
      intravitreal bevacizumab (0.625 mg in 0.025 ml of solution) or conventional laser 
      therapy, bilaterally. The primary ocular outcome was recurrence of retinopathy of 
      prematurity in one or both eyes requiring retreatment before 54 weeks' 
      postmenstrual age. RESULTS: We enrolled 150 infants (total sample of 300 eyes); 
      143 infants survived to 54 weeks' postmenstrual age, and the 7 infants who died 
      were not included in the primary-outcome analyses. Retinopathy of prematurity 
      recurred in 4 infants in the bevacizumab group (6 of 140 eyes [4%]) and 19 
      infants in the laser-therapy group (32 of 146 eyes [22%], P=0.002). A significant 
      treatment effect was found for zone I retinopathy of prematurity (P=0.003) but 
      not for zone II disease (P=0.27). CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal bevacizumab 
      monotherapy, as compared with conventional laser therapy, in infants with stage 
      3+ retinopathy of prematurity showed a significant benefit for zone I but not 
      zone II disease. Development of peripheral retinal vessels continued after 
      treatment with intravitreal bevacizumab, but conventional laser therapy led to 
      permanent destruction of the peripheral retina. This trial was too small to 
      assess safety. (Funded by Research to Prevent Blindness and others; 
      ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00622726.).

TI  - Amyloid, neurodegeneration, and small vessel disease as predictors of dementia in 
      the oldest-old.
PG  - 1804-11
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000000977 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between brain structural changes and 
      β-amyloid deposition, and incident dementia in 183 elderly subjects without 
      dementia (mean age 85.5 years) 2 years later. METHODS: Subjects had a brain 
      structural MRI scan and a PET scan with (11)C-labeled Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) 
      in 2009, and were evaluated clinically in 2011. RESULTS: At baseline evaluation, 
      of the 183 participants (146 cognitively normal [CN]); 37 mild cognitive 
      impairment [MCI]), 139 (76%) were PiB+, had small hippocampal volume (<25th 
      percentile), or had high white matter lesion (WML) volume (>75th percentile). Two 
      years later, 111 (61%) were classified as CN, 51 (28%) as MCI, and 21 (11%) as 
      dementia. At baseline, 51% of the CN participants and 67.5% of the MCI cases were 
      PiB+. Thirty percent of the CN and 51% of the MCI cases had small hippocampi, and 
      24% of the CN and 40.5% of the MCI cases had abnormal WMLs. Of the 21 
      participants who progressed to dementia, 20 (95%) had at least one imaging 
      abnormality. Only 3 (14%) were only PiB+, 1 (5%) had only small hippocampi, 1 
      (5%) had only WMLs, 1 (5%) was biomarker negative, and the other 16 had various 
      pairs of imaging abnormalities. Continuous variables of PiB retention, left and 
      right hippocampal volume, and WML volume were independent predictors of dementia 
      in a logistic regression analysis controlling for age, sex, education level, and 
      Mini-Mental State Examination scores. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of β-amyloid 
      deposition, neurodegeneration (i.e., hippocampal atrophy), and small vessel 
      disease (WMLs) is high in CN older individuals and in MCI. A combination of 2 or 
      3 of these factors is a powerful predictor of short-term incidence of dementia.

AB  - Age-related white matter hyperintensities (WMH) are a manifestation of white 
      matter damage seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They are related to 
      vascular risk factors and cognitive impairment. This study investigated the 
      cognitive profile at different stages of WMH in a large community-dwelling 
      sample; 849 subjects aged 21 to 79 years were classified on the 4-stage Fazekas 
      scale according to hyperintense lesions seen on individual T2-weighted 
      fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI scans. The evaluation of cognitive 
      functioning included seven domains of cognitive performance and five domains of 
      subjective impairment, as proposed by the DSM-5. For the first time, the impact 
      of age-related WMH on Theory of Mind was investigated. Differences between 
      Fazekas groups were analyzed non-parametrically and effect sizes were computed. 
      Effect sizes revealed a slight overall cognitive decline in Fazekas groups 1 and 
      2 relative to healthy subjects. Fazekas group 3 presented substantial decline in 
      social cognition, attention and memory, although characterized by a high 
      inter-individual variability. WMH groups reported subjective cognitive decline. 
      We demonstrate that extensive WMH are associated with specific impairment in 
      attention, memory, social cognition, and subjective cognitive performance. The 
      detailed neuropsychological characterization of WMH offers new therapeutic 
      possibilities for those affected by vascular cognitive decline.

AB  - Interactions between cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) and renal dysfunction 
      (RD) have been reported, but previous studies were mostly retrospective and 
      limited to measurements of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). In this 
      prospective, longitudinal study of patients with CSVD-related recent small 
      subcortical infarcts (RSSI), we aimed at a comprehensive exploration of markers 
      of early RD and their association with microvascular brain damage. We 
      investigated 101 stroke patients (mean age: 60.2 ± 10.7 years) with an 
      MRI-confirmed RSSI who underwent follow-up brain MRI 15 months post-stroke. 
      Besides serum creatinine and eGFR, we assessed urinary Albumin-Creatinine Ratio 
      and fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23). RD was classified according to recent 
      Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. We identified 24 patients 
      with RD, only six patients revealed an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m². RSSI patients 
      with RD more often had severe white matter hyperintensities (WMH, 58% vs. 36%, 
      p = 0.04). CSVD progression was not dependent on RD. However, patients in the 
      highest FGF-23 quartile more frequently had new microangiopathic lesions on 
      follow-up MRI (50% vs. 21%, p = 0.03). Early RD was found in a quarter of RSSI 
      patients and associated with WMH severity, but not CSVD progression. High FGF-23 
      indicates an increased risk for ongoing microvascular brain damage, warranting 
      further studies.

TI  - Effect of Standard vs Intensive Blood Pressure Control on Cerebral Blood Flow in 
      Small Vessel Disease: The PRESERVE Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 720-727
LID - 10.1001/jamaneurol.2017.5153 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Blood pressure (BP) lowering is considered neuroprotective in 
      patients with cerebral small vessel disease; however, more intensive regimens may 
      increase cerebral hypoperfusion. This study examined the effect of standard vs 
      intensive BP treatment on cerebral perfusion in patients with severe small vessel 
      disease. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether standard vs intensive BP lowering over 
      3 months causes decreased cerebral perfusion in small vessel disease. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial took place at 2 English 
      university medical centers. Patients were randomized via a central online system 
      (in a 1:1 ratio). Seventy patients with hypertension and with magnetic resonance 
      imaging-confirmed symptomatic lacunar infarct and confluent white matter 
      hyperintensities were recruited between February 29, 2012, and October 21, 2015, 
      and randomized (36 in the standard group and 34 in the intensive group). 
      Analyzable data were available in 62 patients, 33 in the standard group and 29 in 
      the intensive group, for intent-to-treat analysis. This experiment examines the 
      3-month follow-up period. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to standard 
      (systolic, 130-140 mm Hg) or intensive (systolic, <125 mm Hg) BP targets, to be 
      achieved through medication changes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cerebral 
      perfusion was measured using arterial spin labeling; the primary end point was 
      change in global perfusion between baseline and 3 months, compared between 
      treatment groups by analysis of variance. Linear regression compared change in 
      perfusion against change in BP. Magnetic resonance imaging scan analysis was 
      masked to treatment group. RESULTS: Among 62 analyzable patients, the mean age 
      was 69.3 years, and 60% (n = 37) were male. The mean (SD) systolic BP decreased 
      by 8 (12) mm Hg in the standard group and by 27 (17) mm Hg in the intensive group 
      (P < .001), with mean (SD) achieved pressures of 141 (13) and 126 (10) mm Hg, 
      respectively. Change in global perfusion did not differ between treatment groups: 
      the mean (SD) change was -0.5 (9.4) mL/min/100 g in the standard group vs 0.7 
      (8.6) mL/min/100 g in the intensive group (partial η2, 0.004; 95% CI, -3.551 to 
      5.818; P = .63). No differences were observed when the analysis examined gray or 
      white matter only or was confined to those achieving target BP. The number of 
      adverse events did not differ between treatment groups, with a mean (SD) of 0.21 
      (0.65) for the standard group and 0.32 (0.75) for the intensive group (P = .44). 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Intensive BP lowering did not reduce cerebral 
      perfusion in severe small vessel disease. TRIAL REGISTRATION: isrctn.org

TI  - Aspirin Resistance: Risk Factors and Prognostic Significance in Patients with 
      Cerebral Small Vessel Disease.
PG  - 45-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical significance of aspirin resistance (AR) in patients with 
      symptomatic cerebrovascular disease is not well known. The aim of this 
      single-center, prospective study was to examine the prevalence, risk factors and 
      prognostic significance of AR in patients with different clinical manifestations 
      of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) over 24-month follow-up. METHODS: We 
      studied 104 patients with MRI confirmed CSVD, including those with recent lacunar 
      stroke (LS, n=49), vascular parkinsonism (VaP, n=16) and dementia (VaD, n=39). 
      Platelet aggregation was evaluated with electrode platelet aggregometry 
      (Multiplate analyzer); AR was defined as a value of ≥300 AUC*min. All patients 
      had 24-h ABPM performed at baseline. Radiological progression was recognized 
      based on repeated MRI examinations. RESULTS: The prevalence of AR was 26%, and it 
      did not differ between LS, VaD, and VaP (22.4%, 28.2%, and 31.3%, respectively; 
      p=0.7). The patients with AR had higher triglyceride levels (TG; 144.2±100 vs 
      109.7±48 mg/dl; p=0.09) and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP; 103.5±15.2 vs 
      91.7±10.5 mmHg; p<0.01) than did responders to aspirin (RTA). TG (OR 1.02; 95%CI 
      1-1.11; p=0.04) and MAP (OR 1.03; 95%CI 1.0-1.09; p=0.04) were independent of 
      age, sex, statin and antihypertensive treatment risk factors for AR. The patients 
      with AR more frequently experienced ischemic strokes than did those with RTA (OR 
      3.1; 98%CI 1.08-9.3; p=0.03) and had more radiological progression (OR 2.2; 95%CI 
      0.9-5.7; p=0.08). AR was independent of age, sex, baseline Fazekas score 
      predictor of lacunar stroke (OR 3.79; 95%CI 1.19-12; p=0.02) and radiological 
      progression (OR 2.9; 95%CI 1.04-8.3; p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of AR 
      was high and similar among the patients with LS, VaD, and VaP due to CSVD. Higher 
      24-h MAP and TG were independently related to the risk of AR. AR was associated 
      with risk of radiological progression and lacunar strokes over 24 months of 
      observation.

TI  - Assessing the effectiveness of statin therapy for alleviating cerebral small 
      vessel disease progression in people ≥75 years of age.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Statins have been recommended by several guidelines as the primary 
      prevention medication for cardiovascular diseases. However, the benefits of 
      statin therapy for cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), particularly in adults 
      ≥75 years of age, have not been fully evaluated. METHODS: We analyzed the data 
      from a prospective population-based cohort study and a randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled clinical trial to determine whether statin therapy might aid 
      in slowing the progression of CSVD in adults ≥75 years of age. For the cohort 
      study, 827 participants were considered eligible and were included in the 
      baseline analysis. Subsequently, 781 participants were included in follow-up 
      analysis. For the clinical trial, 227 participants were considered eligible and 
      were used in the baseline and follow-up analyses. RESULTS: The white matter 
      hyperintensities (WMH) volume, the WMH-to-intracranial volume (ICV) ratio, the 
      prevalence of a Fazekas scale score ≥ 2, lacunes, enlarged perivascular spaces 
      (EPVS), and microbleeds were significantly lower in the statin group than the 
      non-statin group at baseline in the cohort study (all P < 0.05). During the 
      follow-up period, in both the cohort and clinical trial studies, the WMH volume 
      and WMH-to-ICV ratio were significantly lower in the statin/rosuvastatin group 
      than the non-statin/placebo group (all P < 0.001). Statin therapy was associated 
      with lower risk of WMH, lacunes, and EPVS progression than the non-statin therapy 
      group after adjustment for confounders (all P < 0.05). There was no statistically 
      significant difference in the risk of microbleeds between the statin and 
      non-statin therapy groups (all, P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated 
      that statin therapy alleviated the progression of WMH, lacunes, and EPVS without 
      elevating the risk of microbleeds. On the basis of the observed results, we 
      concluded that statin therapy is an efficient and safe intervention for CSVD in 
      adults ≥75 years of age. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chictr.org.cn: ChiCTR-IOR-17013557 ,

AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment of lesions in small vessels was associated with worse 
      clinical outcome, and various definitions of "small vessels" have been used. Data 
      with novel drug-eluting stents are scarce. METHODS: To compare the outcome of 
      patients with vs without small-vessel treatment, we assessed 2-year follow-up 
      data of the DUTCH PEERS randomized trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01331707), in 
      which 1,811 all-comers were treated with contemporary zotarolimus-eluting 
      (Resolute Integrity) or everolimus-eluting (Promus Element) stents. Primary end 
      point was target lesion failure (TLF), a composite of cardiac death, target 
      vessel myocardial infarction, and target lesion revascularization. RESULTS: The 
      rates of TLF (9.5% vs 5.4%; P log rank = .001) and 2 individual components 
      thereof-target vessel myocardial infarction (3.1% vs 1.3%; P log rank = .006) and 
      target lesion revascularization (4.8% vs 2.8%; P log rank = .02)-were higher 
      among 798 (44.1%) patients treated in at least one small vessel (<2.50 mm by 
      quantitative coronary angiography). Multivariate analysis with propensity score 
      adjustment demonstrated that treatment of small-vessel lesions independently 
      predicted TLF at 2-year follow-up (hazard ratio 1.60, 95% CI 1.09-2.34). Patients 
      with the smallest target vessel being <2.25 mm had TLF rates similar to patients 
      with smallest target vessels of 2.25 to <2.50 mm; however, patients treated in 
      vessels no smaller than 2.50 to <3.00 mm and patients treated in vessels ≥3.00 mm 
      had lower TLF rates (9.3%, 9.8%, 5.0%, and 5.8%, respectively; P log rank = 
      .009). CONCLUSION: Patients treated with novel drug-eluting stents in 
      small-vessel lesions had higher adverse event rates than did patients who had no 
      small-vessel treatment. Our data suggest that with current stents, a vessel 
      diameter <2.50 mm is a suitable threshold to identify small target vessels.

TI  - A Mediterranean diet lowers blood pressure and improves endothelial function: 
      results from the MedLey randomized intervention trial.
PG  - 1305-1313
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.116.146803 [doi]
AB  - Background: The consumption of a Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is associated with 
      a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. However, its impact on blood pressure and 
      endothelial function is not clear.Objective: We sought to determine the effects 
      of adhering to the consumption of a MedDiet for 6 mo on blood pressure and 
      endothelial function in older, healthy Australians.Design: A total of 166 men and 
      women aged >64 y were allocated via minimization to consume either a MedDiet (n = 
      85) or their habitual diet (HabDiet; control: n = 81) for 6 mo. The MedDiet 
      comprised mainly plant foods, abundant extra-virgin olive oil, and minimal red 
      meat and processed foods. A total of 152 participants commenced the study, and 
      137 subjects completed the study. Home blood pressure was measured on 5 
      consecutive days at baseline (n = 149) and at 3 and 6 mo. Endothelial function (n 
      = 82) was assessed by flow-meditated dilatation (FMD) at baseline and 6 mo. 
      Dietary intake was monitored with the use of 3-d weighed food records. Data were 
      analyzed with the use of linear mixed-effects models to determine adjusted 
      between-group differences.Results: The MedDiet adherence score increased 
      significantly in the MedDiet group but not in the HabDiet group (P < 0.001). The 
      MedDiet, compared with the HabDiet, resulted in lower systolic blood pressure 
      (P-diet × time interaction = 0.02) [mean: -1.3 mm Hg (95% CI: -2.2, -0.3 mm Hg; P 
      = 0.008) at 3 mo and -1.1 mm Hg (95% CI: -2.0, -0.1 mm Hg; P = 0.03) at 6 mo]. At 
      6 mo, the percentage of FMD was higher by 1.3% (95% CI: 0.2%, 2.4%; P = 0.026) in 
      the MedDiet group.Conclusion: Australian men and women who consumed a MedDiet for

AB  - BACKGROUND: Leukoaraiosis is associated with impaired cerebral perfusion, but the 
      effect of individual and combined small-vessel disease (SVD) features on white 
      matter perfusion is unclear. METHODS: We studied patients recruited with 
      perfusion imaging in the Third International Stroke Trial. We rated individual 
      SVD features (leukoaraiosis, lacunes) and brain atrophy on baseline plain 
      computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Separately, we assessed white 
      matter at the level of the lateral ventricles in the cerebral hemisphere 
      contralateral to the stroke for visible areas of hypoperfusion (present or 
      absent) on 4 time-based perfusion imaging parameters. We examined associations 
      between SVD features (individually and summed) and presence of hypoperfusion 
      using logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, baseline National Institutes of 
      Health Stroke Scale, hypertension, and diabetes. RESULTS: A total of 115 patients 
      with median (interquartile range) age of 81 (72-86) years, 78 (52%) of which were 
      male, had complete perfusion data. Hypoperfusion was most frequent on mean 
      transit time (MTT; 63 patients, 55%) and least frequent on time to maximum flow 
      (19 patients, 17%). The SVD score showed stronger independent associations with 
      hypoperfusion (e.g., MTT, odds ratio [OR] = 2.80; 95% confidence interval 
      [CI] = 1.56-5.03) than individual SVD markers (e.g., white matter hypoattenuation 
      score, MTT, OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.09-2.04). Baseline blood pressure did not 
      differ by presence or absence of hypoperfusion or across strata of SVD score. 
      Presence of white matter hypoperfusion increased with SVD summed score. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The SVD summed score was associated with hypoperfusion more 
      consistently than individual SVD features, providing validity to the SVD score 
      concept. Increasing SVD burden indicates worse perfusion in the white matter.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Subcortical small vessel disease, represented as white matter 
      hyperintensity (WMH) on magnetic resonance images (MRI) is associated with 
      functional decline in older people with hypertension. We evaluated the 
      relationships of clinic and out-of-office blood pressures (BP) with WMH and 
      functional status in older persons. METHODS: Using cross-sectional data from 199 
      older study participants enrolled in the INFINITY trial, we analyzed the clinic, 
      24-hour ambulatory, and home BPs and their relationships with WMH burden and 
      mobility and cognitive outcomes. RESULTS: Volume of WMH was associated with 
      clinic and 24-hour ambulatory systolic BP but not home systolic BP. The mobility 
      measure, supine-to-sit time, had a significant association with 24-hour systolic 
      BP and pulse pressure but not with diastolic BP or values obtained by home BP. 
      Cognitive measures of processing speed (Trails Making Test Part A and the Stroop 
      Word Test) were significantly associated with 24-hour systolic BP, but not clinic 
      and home BPs. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that ambulatory BP measurements 
      in older people are more strongly associated with WMH and certain measures of 
      functional status compared to home BP measurements. Hence, home BP may not be a 
      useful substitute for ambulatory BP for assessing subcortical small vessel 
      disease and its consequences. Further longitudinal analyses comparing clinic and 
      various types of out-of-office BP measures with small vessel brain disease are 
      needed. Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01650402.

TI  - Preventing cognitive decline and dementia from cerebral small vessel disease: The 
      LACI-1 Trial. Protocol and statistical analysis plan of a phase IIa dose 
      escalation trial testing tolerability, safety and effect on intermediary 
      endpoints of isosorbide mononitrate and cilostazol, separately and in 
      combination.
PG  - 530-538

AB  - Rationale The pathophysiology of most lacunar stroke, a form of small vessel 
      disease, is thought to differ from large artery atherothrombo- or cardio-embolic 
      stroke. Licensed drugs, isosorbide mononitrate and cilostazol, have promising 
      mechanisms of action to support their testing to prevent stroke recurrence, 
      cognitive impairment, or radiological progression after lacunar stroke. Aim 
      LACI-1 will assess the tolerability, safety, and efficacy, by dose, of isosorbide 
      mononitrate and cilostazol, alone and in combination, in patients with ischemic 
      lacunar stroke. Sample size A sample of 60 provides 80+% power (significance 
      0.05) to detect a difference of 35% (90% versus 55%) between those reaching 
      target dose on one versus both drugs. Methods and design LACI-1 is a phase IIa 
      partial factorial, dose-escalation, prospective, randomized, open label, blinded 
      endpoint trial. Participants are randomized to isosorbide mononitrate and/or 
      cilostazol for 11 weeks with dose escalation to target as tolerated in two 
      centers (Edinburgh, Nottingham). At three visits, tolerability, safety, blood 
      pressure, pulse wave velocity, and platelet function are assessed, plus magnetic 
      resonance imaging to assess cerebrovascular reactivity in a subgroup. Study 
      outcomes Primary: proportion of patients completing study achieving target 
      maximum dose. Secondary symptoms whilst taking medications; safety (hemorrhage, 
      recurrent vascular events, falls); blood pressure, platelet function, arterial 
      stiffness, and cerebrovascular reactivity. Discussion This study will inform the 
      design of a larger phase III trial of isosorbide mononitrate and cilostazol in 
      lacunar stroke, whilst providing data on the drugs' effects on vascular and 
      platelet function. Trial registration ISRCTN (ISRCTN12580546) and EudraCT

AB  - BACKGROUND: Small vessel disease (SMD) remains a major challenge because of the 
      increased risk of restenosis. We sought to assess the efficacy and safety of a 
      paclitaxel-eluting balloon (PEB) in patients with SMD. METHODS AND RESULTS: 
      One-hundred and four patients with native coronary lesions in small vessels 
      treated by using a PEB were included in this prospective multicenter registry. In 
      each case, after regular balloon dilatation, a larger PEB was inflated for a 
      minimum of 45-60 seconds. Patients were 65 ± 10 years old, 43% diabetic, and 58% 
      presented acutely. Angiographic success was 93% (7% bailout BMS implantation due 
      to coronary dissection). The rate of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 12 
      months was 4.8% (1.9% cardiac death, 1.0% MI, and 2.9% TLR). One definite stent 
      thrombosis was reported at 6 months in a patient with bailout BMS implantation. 
      At 7 months, late loss was 0.31 ± 0.2 mm. Bail-out BMS after DEB use, was an 
      independent predictor of MACE, HR 18.74, 95%CI (2.58-135.84) and TLR, HR 30.99, 
      95%CI (2.79-344.07). CONCLUSION: The use of this PEB for the treatment of SMD 
      provides excellent 1-year outcomes with only 4.8% MACE. The need for a bailout 
      BMS was a strong predictor of MACE and TLR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebral small vessel disease is a common cause of vascular cognitive 
      impairment in older people, with no licensed treatment. Cerebral blood flow is 
      reduced in small vessel disease. Tadalafil is a widely prescribed 
      phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor that increases blood flow in other vascular 
      territories. The aim of this trial is to test the hypothesis that tadalafil 
      increases cerebral blood flow in older people with small vessel disease. 
      METHODS/DESIGN: Perfusion by Arterial Spin labelling following Single dose 
      Tadalafil In Small vessel disease (PASTIS) is a phase II randomised double-blind 
      crossover trial. In two visits, 7-30 days apart, participants undergo arterial 
      spin labelling to measure cerebral blood flow and a battery of cognitive tests, 
      pre- and post-dosing with oral tadalafil (20 mg) or placebo. SAMPLE SIZE: 54 
      participants are required to detect a 15% increase in cerebral blood flow in 
      subcortical white matter (p < 0.05, 90% power). Primary outcomes are cerebral 
      blood flow in subcortical white matter and deep grey nuclei. Secondary outcomes 
      are cortical grey matter cerebral blood flow and performance on cognitive tests 
      (reaction time, information processing speed, digit span forwards and backwards, 
      semantic fluency). DISCUSSION: Recruitment started on 4th September 2015 and 36 
      participants have completed to date (19th April 2017). No serious adverse events 
      have occurred. All participants have been recruited from one centre, St George's 
      University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. TRIAL REGISTRATION: European Union 
      Clinical Trials Register: EudraCT number 2015-001235-20 . Registered on 13 May 
      2015.

AB  - AIM: We investigated the efficacy and safety of using paclitaxel-coated balloon 
      (PCB) to treat small vessel disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this multicenter, 
      prospective, randomized controlled trial, one-hundred and thirty-five patients 
      with native coronary lesions in small vessels were randomized into a PCB group 
      and plain balloon angioplasty (POBA) group at a ratio of 2:1. There were no 
      differences in target vessel failure (TVF) that was defined as cardiac death or 
      target vessel-related myocardial infarction or target lesion revascularization 
      (TLR), between the two groups (3.4 vs. 10.3%; P = 0.20), and TLR was slightly 
      lower in the PCB group (2.3%) than that in the POBA group (10.3%) during 24 weeks 
      follow-up. The late lumen loss (LLL) was significantly lower in the PCB group 
      (0.01 ± 0.31 vs. 0.32 ± 0.34 mm; P < 0.01) and late lumen enlargement (LLE) was 
      more frequently observed in the PCB group (48 vs. 15%; P < 0.01) by angiographic 
      follow-up after 24 weeks. There were no cases of death, myocardial infarction, 
      thrombosis and reocclusion in either group. CONCLUSIONS: This study was not able 
      to demonstrate superiority of PCB compared with POBA.

TI  - Using DTI to assess white matter microstructure in cerebral small vessel disease 
      (SVD) in multicentre studies.
PG  - 1361-1373
LID - 10.1042/CS20170146 [doi]
AB  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and 
      mean diffusivity (MD) have been proposed as clinical trial markers of cerebral 
      small vessel disease (SVD) due to their associations with outcomes such as 
      cognition. However, studies investigating this have been predominantly 
      single-centre. As clinical trials are likely to be multisite, further studies are 
      required to determine whether associations with cognition of similar strengths 
      can be detected in a multicentre setting. One hundred and nine patients (mean age 
      =68 years) with symptomatic lacunar infarction and confluent white matter 
      hyperintensities (WMH) on MRI was recruited across six sites as part of the 
      PRESERVE DTI substudy. After handling missing data, 3T-MRI scanning was available 
      from five sites on five scanner models (Siemens and Philips), alongside 
      neuropsychological and quality of life (QoL) assessments. FA median and MD peak 
      height were extracted from DTI histogram analysis. Multiple linear regressions 
      were performed, including normalized brain volume, WMH lesion load, and n° 
      lacunes as covariates, to investigate the association of FA and MD with cognition 
      and QoL. DTI metrics from all white matter were significantly associated with 
      global cognition (standardized β =0.268), mental flexibility (β =0.306), verbal 
      fluency (β =0.376), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (β =0.273). The 
      magnitudes of these associations were comparable with those previously reported 
      from single-centre studies found in a systematic literature review. In this 
      multicentre study, we confirmed associations between DTI parameters and 
      cognition, which were similar in strength to those found in previous 
      single-centre studies. The present study supports the use of DTI metrics as 
      biomarkers of disease progression in multicentre studies.

AB  - Due to the indistinct nature of symptoms for Cerebral Small Vessel Disease 
      (CSVD), diagnosis is often missed. With significant deterioration of movement 
      disorder, risk of falls increases dramatically.Comparison study was conducted to 
      explore the association between balance function and gait instability, and the 
      treatment effectiveness of visual feedback balance training on the gait disorder 
      in CSVD patients.Fifty-six patients with CSVD were studied. They were randomly 
      divided into observation and control groups, and were given conventional gait 
      rehabilitation training, including single-leg weight, shift of the center of 
      gravity, step and hip extension training, stepping up and down on stairs with the 
      affected leg, standing up with hip extension and support of the leg, lateral 
      walking, and in situ walking. Training was performed twice a day for 20 minutes 
      each for 4 consecutive weeks. In addition, the observation group received balance 
      training using Pro-Kin visual feedback balance training system. Both groups were 
      evaluated prior and post-treatment using the Tinetti Scale and the Pro-Kin Visual 
      Feedback Balance Training System. For the Tinetti Scale, lower score indicates 
      more serious gait balance dysfunction. For the Pro-Kin, greater length means 
      poorer balance function. Larger area means poorer balance function. Smaller value 
      of the 2 parameters indicates better balance function.After training, the 
      trajectory lengths and areas of orbital motions were significantly decreased 
      (P < .05). However greater decrease was seen in the observation group (P < .01). 
      The trajectory length and area for both groups were less when the eyes open than 
      closed (P < .01). The Tinetti scores for balance and gait functions of both 
      groups improved significantly (P < .05). However, the observation group showed 
      even greater results than the control group (P < .01). Results from Person test 
      showed there was a significant correlation between balance and gait 
      functions.Combination of visual feedback balance training with conventional 
      rehabilitation treatment could gain a greater result than conventional 
      rehabilitation alone. It indicates that balance training may serve as an 
      additional method for gait stability training for CSVD patients.

TI  - Anti-endothelial cell antibodies in patients with cerebral small vessel disease.
PG  - 296-301
AB  - The pathogenesis of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) in the elderly is poorly 
      understood. Endothelial cell activation and dysfunction may play a causal role in 
      the pathogenesis of CSVD. It was reported that anti-endothelial cell antibodies 
      (AECAs) are associated with endothelial cell dysfunction and inflammation. We 
      hypothesized that AECAs may be associated with the pathogenesis of CSVD. We 
      examined AECAs in sera from 12 elderly subjects with CSVD, 12 elderly subjects 
      without CSVD, and 18 healthy volunteers by 2-dimensional immunoblotting using 
      primary cultured human brain microvascular endothelial cells as the antigen 
      source. We identified 4 AECAs that were detected in sera from more than one-half 
      of the elderly subjects with CSVD. Subsequently, we analyzed the target antigens 
      of these 4 antibodies by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The 
      target antigens of these 4 antibodies were tropomyosin alpha-4 chain (TPM4), 
      vimentin, alpha-enolase, and annexin A2. Among these 4 antibodies, the anti-TPM4 
      antibody was significantly more frequently detected in sera from the elderly 
      subjects with CSVD than the other subjects. We determined the anti-TPM4 antibody 
      level in sera from 21 elderly subjects with CSVD and 25 subjects without CSVD by 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The anti-TPM4 antibody level was significantly 
      higher in the subjects with than without CSVD. Therefore, an autoimmune, 
      inflammatory process with high levels of anti-TPM4 antibody may contribute to the 
      development of CSVD in the elderly.

TI  - Placebo-controlled trial of high-dose atorvastatin in patients with severe 
      cerebral small vessel disease.
PG  - 1721-8
LID - 10.1161/STROKEAHA.108.540088 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Uncontrolled studies have shown that statins can improve 
      cerebral vasoreactivity (CVR) in patients with mild small vessel disease. We 
      sought to determine whether high-dose atorvastatin increases CVR compared with 
      placebo in patients with severe small vessel disease. METHODS: Ninety-four adults 
      with recent lacunar stroke were randomly allocated in a double-blind manner to 80 
      mg of atorvastatin daily or matching placebo after stratification for 
      hypertensive and diabetic status. The primary end point was change in CVR after 3 
      months of treatment. Secondary outcomes were changes in brachial and carotid 
      artery endothelial-dependent vasodilations. RESULTS: At baseline, all patients 
      had a severely impaired CVR (mean, 12.1%; 95% CI, 9.5-14.7) and carotid (mean, 
      -0.25%; 95% CI, -1.17-0.67) and brachial artery (mean, 2.72%; 95% CI, 1.39-4.05) 
      endothelial function. Despite reductions of 55% in low-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol and of 30% in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in the active arm 
      compared to placebo, atorvastatin 80 mg per day did not improve CVR or 
      endothelial dysfunction of carotid and brachial arteries. CONCLUSIONS: We found 
      no positive effect of 3-month treatment with atorvastatin on severe cerebral 
      microvasculature endothelial dysfunction in patients with lacunar stroke.

TI  - The effects of DL-3-n-butylphthalide in patients with vascular cognitive

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vascular cognitive impairment without dementia is very common among 
      the aged and tends to progress to dementia, but there have been no proper 
      large-scale intervention trials dedicated to it. Vascular cognitive impairment 
      without dementia caused by subcortical ischemic small vessel disease 
      (hereinafter, subcortical Vascular cognitive impairment without dementia) 
      represents a relatively homogeneous disease process and is a suitable target for 
      therapeutic trials investigating Vascular cognitive impairment without dementia. 
      Preclinical trials showed that dl-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) is effective for 
      cognitive impairment of vascular origin. METHODS: In this randomized, 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we enrolled patients aged 50-70 years who 
      had a diagnosis of subcortical Vascular cognitive impairment without dementia at 
      15 academic medical centers in China. Inclusion criteria included a clinical 
      dementia rating ≥0.5 on at least one domain and global score ≤0.5; a mini-mental 
      state examination score ≥20 (primary school) or ≥24 (junior school or above); and 
      brain magnetic resonance imaging consistent with subcortical ischemic small 
      vessel disease. Patients were randomly assigned to NBP 200 mg three times daily 
      or matched placebo (1:1) for 24 weeks according to a computer-generated 
      randomization protocol. All patients and study personnel were masked to treatment 
      assignment. Primary outcome measures were the changes in Alzheimer's disease 
      assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) and clinician's interview-based 
      impression of change plus caregiver input (CIBIC-plus) after 24 weeks. All 
      patients were monitored for adverse events (AEs). Outcome measures were analyzed 
      for both the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and the per protocol population. 
      RESULTS: This study enrolled 281 patients. NBP showed greater effects than 
      placebo on ADAS-cog (NBP change -2.46 vs. placebo -1.39; P = .03; ITT) and 
      CIBIC-plus (80 [57.1%] vs. 59 [42.1%] patients improved; P = .01; ITT). 
      NBP-related AE were uncommon and primarily consisted of mild gastrointestinal 
      symptoms. DISCUSSION: Over the 6-month treatment period, NBP was effective for 
      improving cognitive and global functioning in patients with subcortical vascular 
      cognitive impairment without dementia and exhibited good safety.
