1,10414620_1,10414620, Iron deficiency anaemia and adverse dietary habits in hospitalised children. ,"AIMS: To determine the prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia in children hospitalised with acute illness and the frequency of adverse dietary habits in the children with iron deficiency anaemia. METHODS: This was a prospective study of all children, aged 9 to 23 months resident in metropolitan Auckland who were hospitalised at Starship Children's Hospital, from July to October 1997, with an acute medical illness and had a full blood count performed. Iron deficiency anaemia was defined as haemoglobin <110 g/L, red cell distribution width >14.5% and either serum ferritin <10 microg/L or transferrin saturation <10%. Ethnicity and dietary habits of the children were determined by interviewing parents. RESULTS: During the study period 284 children, aged 9 to 23 months were admitted, of whom 206 (73%) had a full blood count performed. Sixty (29%) of these 206 children had iron deficiency anaemia. A larger proportion of Pacific Islands (P) compared to Maori (M) or European children (E) had iron deficiency anaemia. (P vs M:43% vs 21%, p=0.01; P vs E:43% vs 14%, p<0.001; M vs E 21% vs 14%, P=0.27). Sixty-nine percent of the children with iron deficiency anaemia had a dietary factor (early introduction of cows milk, late introduction of meat or regular consumption of tea) likely to have contributed to their iron deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Iron deficiency is prevalent in Auckland children aged 9 to 23 months, hospitalised with an acute illness. The prevalence varies with ethnicity. Adverse dietary habits are present in 69% of the children with iron deficiency anaemia.","islands,maori,children,",hospitalised children  ,"factor ( early introduction of cows milk , late introduction of meat or regular consumption of tea ) likely to have contributed to their iron deficiency .

2,10655270_1,10655270, Iron overload in cirrhosis-HFE genotypes and outcome after liver transplantation. ,"Previously, we found appreciable hepatic iron deposition in one third of our patients undergoing liver transplantation (LTx) with approximately 10% of cases having quantifiable iron in the range of that seen in hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC). The aim of this study was to compare clinical outcome in liver transplant patients with and without iron overload. We also sought to determine the prevalence of HFE mutations in liver transplant patients with iron overload. Of 456 consecutive liver transplants, 41 explants had an hepatic iron index (HII) greater than 1.9, and these cases were compared to 41 matched liver transplant recipients without increased hepatic iron. Posttransplantation complications, along with patient and graft survival were monitored. HFE gene testing was performed using DNA-based techniques. Kaplan-Meier 5-year patient survival after LTx was significantly lower in cases with hepatic iron overload compared to matched controls without iron excess (48% vs. 77%; P =.045). Fatal infections (especially fungal) were more common in patients with iron overload (24% vs. 7%; P =.03). Of the 41 patients with a liver explant HII greater than 1.9, only 4 were C282Y homozygotes. Patients with severe hepatic explant iron overload undergoing LTx have a reduced survival compared to liver transplant recipients without explant iron excess. The reduced survival was attributable mainly to fatal bacterial and fungal infections. Despite the iron overload, HFE gene mutations were uncommon in patients with hepatic explant hemosiderosis.","hfe mutations, liver transplant, hereditary hemochromatosis,hepatic iron index,",cirrhosis hfe genotypes  ou  one third   patients,in one third of our patients undergoing liver transplantation ( LTx ) with approximately 10 % of cases having quantifiable iron in the range of that seen in hereditary hemochromatosis ( HHC ) .

3,10841219_1,10841219," The use of subcutaneous erythropoietin and intravenous iron for the treatment of the anemia of severe, resistant congestive heart failure improves cardiac and renal function and functional cardiac class, and markedly reduces hospitalizations. ","OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the prevalence and severity of anemia in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and the effect of its correction on cardiac and renal function and hospitalization. BACKGROUND: The prevalence and significance of mild anemia in patients with CHF is uncertain, and the role of erythropoietin with intravenous iron supplementation in treating this anemia is unknown. METHODS: In a retrospective study, the records of the 142 patients in our CHF clinic were reviewed to find the prevalence and severity of anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] <12 g). In an intervention study, 26 of these patients, despite maximally tolerated therapy of CHF for at least six months, still had had severe CHF and were also anemic. They were treated with subcutaneous erythropoietin and intravenous iron sufficient to increase the Hb to 12 g%. The doses of the CHF medications, except for diuretics, were not changed during the intervention period. RESULTS: The prevalence of anemia in the 142 patients increased with the severity of CHF, reaching 79.1% in those with New York Heart Association class IV. In the intervention study, the anemia of the 26 patients was treated for a mean of 7.2 +/- 5.5 months. The mean Hb level and mean left ventricular ejection fraction increased significantly. The mean number of hospitalizations fell by 91.9% compared with a similar period before the study. The New York Heart Association class fell significantly, as did the doses of oral and intravenous furosemide. The rate of fall of the glomerular filtration rate slowed with the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Anemia is very common in CHF and its successful treatment is associated with a significant improvement in cardiac function, functional class, renal function and in a marked fall in the need for diuretics and hospitalization.","subcutaneous erythropoietin, intravenous iron, , anemia,  142,  congestive heart failure,", intravenous iron   t  anemia   142 patients,"were also anemic .

6,11206959_1,11206959, Iron overload is a determinant of morbidity and mortality in adult patients with sickle cell disease. ,"Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) often require blood transfusion starting in early childhood. Multiple blood transfusions on a chronic basis lead to excessive accumulation of iron, especially in adults with sickle cell anemia (SS) that is progressively increasing in size. Blood exchange transfusion and the use of iron chelation therapy may prevent or delay the onset of iron overload. The majority of adults with SS, however, require episodic blood transfusions on a chronic basis and, hence, are at risk to develop iron overload. Recent reports suggest an association between iron overload and organ failure in chronically transfused patients. Patients with SCD and iron overload may thus be at increased risk to develop organ failure compared to those with normal iron stores. In order to clarify this issue we have prospectively collected the following data on our adult patients with SCD between 1978 and 1998: (1) the amount of blood transfused; and (2) the status of iron stores determined with serum ferritin, serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and percent transferrin saturation (% Sat). Between 1987 and 1998, 247 adult patients with SS were regularly followed in our sickle cell center. Of these, 152 (62%) were transfused with 4,875 units of red blood cells (RBCs). Transfused patients received an average of 10 units of RBCs per year, which is equivalent to about 2.0 g of iron per year. This does not include transfusions at other institutions or before 1987. About one third of the adult patients with SS had % Sat greater than 50 in the steady state, suggesting iron overload. During painful episodes serum ferritin increased significantly in paired observations. Serum iron and TIBC decreased during painful episode disproportionately so that there was a significant net decrease in % Sat in paired observations. Patients with low values of serum ferritin and % Sat had lower incidence of acute painful episodes (38% v 64%) and organ failure (19% v 71%) than those who had iron overload, respectively. Mortality was significantly higher in the iron overload group: 64% versus 5%, respectively. Taken together, the data indicate that (1) the status of iron stores in adults with SS is best determined by keeping accurate records of the amount of blood transfused and serial determinations of ferritin levels in the steady state; (2) a significant number of adults with SS have iron overload; and (3) iron overload seems to be a predisposing factor of disease severity.","acute painful episodes, sickle cell disease,cell anemia,total iron binding capacity,",adult patients  sickle cel patients  low values  serum ferritin ,"steady state , suggesting iron overload .

","BACKGROUND: Although iron deficiency occurs commonly in vulnerable groups of women of reproductive age, infants, and children, less is known about the iron nutriture of the elderly. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate the iron status of a noninstitutionalized, elderly US population, with a particular focus on 2 concerns unique to the elderly: 1) potential confounding effects of chronic disease on iron measures and 2) increased occurrence of elevated iron stores. DESIGN: Multiple iron measures, including serum ferritin (SF), transferrin saturation, mean cell volume, and hemoglobin, were used to evaluate the prevalence of iron deficiency (ID), iron deficiency anemia (IDA), and other measures of iron nutriture in 1016 elderly white Americans aged 67-96 y from the Framingham Heart Study. ""Diseased"" subjects were defined as those with possible pathologically altered iron measures due to inflammation, infection, elevated liver enzymes, hereditary hemochromatosis, or cancer. The effect of altered iron status on various prevalence estimates was assessed. RESULTS: The elderly subjects had a low prevalence of ID (2.7%), IDA (1.2%), and depleted iron stores (3%; SF < 12 microg/L). In contrast, 12.9% had elevated iron stores (SF > 300 microg/L in men and SF > 200 microg/L in women), of which only 1% was attributable to chronic disease. The prevalence of ID, IDA, and depleted iron stores was unaffected by the presence of chronic disease. CONCLUSIONS: The Framingham Heart Study cohort is an iron-replete elderly population with a high prevalence of elevated iron stores in contrast with a low prevalence of iron deficiency, with insignificant effects of chronic disease on these iron status estimates. The likely liability in iron nutriture in free-living, elderly white Americans eating a Western diet is high iron stores, not iron deficiency.","iron deficiency, serum ferritin,iron deficiency,iron deficiency anemia,", ,"the Framingham Heart Study .

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate the iron status of a noninstitutionalized, elderly US population, with a particular focus on 2 concerns unique to the elderly: 1) potential confounding effects of chronic disease on iron measures and 2) increased occurrence of elevated iron stores. DESIGN: Multiple iron measures, including serum ferritin (SF), transferrin saturation, mean cell volume, and hemoglobin, were used to evaluate the prevalence of iron deficiency (ID), iron deficiency anemia (IDA), and other measures of iron nutriture in 1016 elderly white Americans aged 67-96 y from the Framingham Heart Study. ""Diseased"" subjects were defined as those with possible pathologically altered iron measures due to inflammation, infection, elevated liver enzymes, hereditary hemochromatosis, or cancer. The effect of altered iron status on various prevalence estimates was assessed. RESULTS: The elderly subjects had a low prevalence of ID (2.7%), IDA (1.2%), and depleted iron stores (3%; SF < 12 microg/L). In contrast, 12.9% had elevated iron stores (SF > 300 microg/L in men and SF > 200 microg/L in women), of which only 1% was attributable to chronic disease. The prevalence of ID, IDA, and depleted iron stores was unaffected by the presence of chronic disease. CONCLUSIONS: The Framingham Heart Study cohort is an iron-replete elderly population with a high prevalence of elevated iron stores in contrast with a low prevalence of iron deficiency, with insignificant effects of chronic disease on these iron status estimates.

16,11967034_1,11967034, Sodium ferric gluconate complex in hemodialysis patients: adverse reactions compared to placebo and iron dextran. ,"BACKGROUND: Parenteral iron is often required by hemodialysis patients to maintain adequate iron stores. Until recently, the only available form of intravenous iron was iron dextran, which is associated with significant adverse reactions, including anaphylaxis and death. Sodium ferric gluconate complex (SFGC) was recently approved for use in the U.S. under FDA's priority drug review. This Phase IV study was designed to evaluate the safety of a single dose of intravenous SFGC as compared to placebo and a historical iron dextran control. METHODS: This multicenter, crossover, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled prospective comparative study was performed in hemodialysis patients requiring at least 125 mg of elemental iron. The historical control was obtained from a meta-analysis of four publications examining outcomes in patients exposed to iron dextran. SFGC nave patients were administered SFGC without a test dose, undiluted, at a rate of 125 mg over 10 minutes, and compared to placebo comprising bacteriostatic saline. RESULTS: A total of 2534 patients were enrolled. The incidence of drug intolerance (an adverse event precluding re-exposure) was significantly less [0.44%, confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 0.71%] after SFGC as compared to the iron dextran control (2.47%, CI 1.87 to 3.07%, P < 0.0001), but higher than after placebo (0.1%, P = 0.02). There was no difference found between SFGC and placebo in serious adverse events. A single life-threatening event occurred after SFGC (0.04%, CI 0.00 to 0.22%), which was significantly less than following iron dextran (0.61%, CI 0.36 to 0.86%), P = 0.0001. CONCLUSION: SFGC is well tolerated when given by intravenous push without a test dose. SFGC has a significantly lower incidence of drug intolerance and life-threatening events as compared to previous studies using iron dextran. The routine use of iron dextran in hemodialysis patients should be discontinued.","drug intolerance, sodium ferric gluconate complex,confidence interval,",hemodialysis patients: adverse sfgc nave patients,"iron dextran .

25,12214547_1,12214547, Prevalence of anemia during pregnancy: results of Valencia (Venezuela) anemia during pregnancy study. ,"To determine the prevalence of anemia during pregnancy in Venezuelan pregnant women. By using a cross-sectional study, 630 Venezuelan pregnant women in their third trimester at labor from the Valencia Anemia during Pregnancy Study were studied. Anemia during pregnancy was defined according to WHO guidelines (Hb < 11 g/dl), iron deficiency was considered when serum ferritin level was < 12 ng/ml, and when serum folate level was < 3 ng/ml, it was considered as folate deficiency. 630 pregnant women (mean [+/- SD] age, 24 +/- 6.4 years) having an average of Hb 11.38 +/- 1.47 g/dl [95%CI = 11.27 to 11.50] were studied. No patient had hemolytic anemia nor clinical infections. Almost all patients were from low or very low socioeconomic status. Prevalence of anemia was 34.44% (severe: 1.8%, moderate: 15.2%, and mild: 83%). Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) was present in 39.2% (95%CI = 32.7 to 45.7), prevalence of folate deficiency anemia (FDA) was 11.98% (95%CI = 7.6% to 16.3%).

32,12406023_1,12406023, No increase in mortality and morbidity among carriers of the C282Y mutation of the hereditary haemochromatosis gene in the oldest old: the Leiden 85-plus study. ,"BACKGROUND: The C282Y mutation in the gene for haemochromatosis (HFE) has been associated with various diseases at middle age. However, recent studies indicate that penetrance of the C282Y mutation is low. We explored the association between the C282Y mutation, iron metabolism, and morbidity and mortality in participants of the Leiden 85-plus. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional comparison and prospective follow-up was conducted in two unselected cohorts of 661 and 552 subjects. All subjects were aged 85 years and over. We determined the prevalence of C282Y homozygous and heterozygous subjects, and the association between the C282Y mutation and iron metabolism, all-cause and specific causes of death. RESULTS: Prevalence of C282Y homozygosity in both cohorts was 0.2% (1/661 and 1/552, respectively) and of C282Y heterozygosity was 12.4% (82/661) and 11.4% (63/552), respectively. These estimates coincide exactly with reported estimates in younger age groups. Median ferritin level was 97 microg L-1 (IQR 39-162) for heterozygous carriers and 89 microg L-1 (IQR 41-157) for noncarriers (P = 0.66). The serum ferritin concentration for one C282Y homozygous subject, a woman aged 86 years at the time of enrollment in 1986, was 392 microg L-1. Cardiovascular morbidity was comparable between the C282Y heterozygous subjects and the noncarriers in both study cohorts. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality of carriers of the C282Y mutation was similar to that in noncarriers. CONCLUSIONS: We found two C282Y homozygous subjects, illustrating that homozygosity can be compatible with survival in very old ages. C282Y heterozygosity was not associated with history of cardiovascular disease morbidity, all cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, or biochemical phenotype of haemochromatosis at old age.","c282y homozygous, heterozygous subjects, gene, haemochromatosis,",mortality  morbidity among  ,"was conducted in two unselected cohorts of 661 and 552 subjects .

METHODS: Worksite-based intervention program was implemented 110 000 employees at Capital Iron and Steel Company of Beijing (CISC) focusing on primary prevention for CVD and control of hypertension. Intervention components comprised of infrastructure setting-up, health education and health promotion, professional training, detection and management of hypertensive patients, and reasonably readjusting their diet structure focusing on salt intake reduction, reducing their overweight, quitting smoking, and restricting alcohol consumption in high-risk population. Changes in level of risk factors, incidence and mortality of stroke and coronary events and their trend were evaluated between the intervention group at CISC and eight simultaneously parallel reference groups in other provinces outside Beijing with population surveillance data. RESULTS: Major risk factors for CVD, including blood pressure, body mass index and serum cholesterol level, decreased relatively in intervention population at CISC during 1974 to 1998, while those in majority of eight parallel reference groups at different provinces of China significantly increased at the same time. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased by 0.8 mm Hg and 4 mm Hg in average for men and women, respectively, and their diastolic blood pressure (DBP) remained the same as baseline for both men and women at CISC, while SBP increased by (2 - 11) mm Hg and (6 - 8) mm Hg in average for men and women, respectively in reference groups, and DBP increased by (2 - 6) mm Hg in average for men in five of eight reference groups, and by (3 - 6) mm Hg for women in four of eight reference groups.

44,15037530_1,15037530, Taurine supplementation reduces oxidative stress and improves cardiovascular function in an iron-overload murine model. ,"BACKGROUND: Iron overload has an increasing worldwide prevalence and is associated with significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Elevated iron levels in the myocardium lead to impaired systolic and diastolic function and elevated oxidative stress. Taurine accounts for 25% to 50% of the amino acid pool in myocardium, possesses antioxidant properties, and can inhibit L-type Ca2+ channels. Thus, we hypothesized that this agent would reduce the cardiovascular effects of iron overload. METHODS AND RESULTS: Iron-overloaded mice were generated by intraperitoneal injection of iron either chronically (5 days per week for 13 weeks) or subacutely (5 days per week for 4 weeks). Iron overload causes increased mortality, elevated oxidative stress, systolic and diastolic dysfunction, hypotension, and bradycardia. Taurine supplementation increased myocardial taurine levels by 45% and led to reductions in mortality and improved cardiac function, heart rate, and blood pressure in iron-overloaded mice. Histological examination of the myocardium revealed reduced apoptosis and interstitial fibrosis in iron-overloaded mice supplemented with taurine. Taurine mediated reduced oxidative stress in iron-overloaded mice along with attenuation of myocardial lipid peroxidation and protection of reduced glutathione level. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that treatment with taurine reduces iron-mediated myocardial oxidative stress, preserves cardiovascular function, and improves survival in iron-overloaded mice.

47,15201636_1,15201636," Laboratory markers carbohydrate-deficient transferrin, gamma-glutamyltransferase, and mean corpuscular volume are not useful as screening tools for high-risk drinking in the general population: results from the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP). ","BACKGROUND: Assessment of high-risk drinking in the general population can be problematic: questionnaire-based instruments may carry the problem of random or systematic recall bias, and the effectiveness of screening of single biomarkers has been shown to be insufficient. In this article, we analyze the alcohol intake/biomarker relationship of carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), and erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Specific aims were (1) screening effectiveness comparison of GGT, CDT, and MCV in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and positive (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs) and the effect of covariates on these measures; (2) the comparison of summary measures for the effectiveness of screening: the receiver characteristic curve (ROC) and the area under the ROC; and (3) to answer the question of which covariates effect which biomarkers and whether accounting for relevant covariates increases the prognostic value of biomarkers to levels that allow for application in the general population. METHODS: In a representative cross-sectional health survey in northeast Germany with data collection from 1997 to 2001, 4310 men and women were asked for their recent alcohol consumption and smoking. Biomarkers were analyzed from blood samples. The effectiveness of screening of CDT, GGT, and MCV for high-risk drinking (men: >60 g/day, women: >40 g/day) was analyzed with PPV and ROC curve analysis. RESULTS: For all three biomarkers, PPVs for high-risk drinking are very low (< 50%). There are some effects of covariates on screening effectiveness and on PPV, and knowledge of these covariates increases screening effectiveness, but no subgroup that had a combination of covariate levels and prevalence of high-risk drinking that led to a PPV > 50% could be found. CONCLUSIONS: : Accounting for covariates in the screening procedure does not lead to a sufficient increase in PPV. Screening effectiveness of laboratory markers CDT, GGT, and MCV is insufficient for their application as screening tools for high-risk alcohol drinking in the general population. This was found using self-reported alcohol consumption as an imperfect gold standard, which is a limitation of the study, although self-reports are the standard instrument in comparable epidemiologic studies.","high risk drinking, led, carbohydrate deficient transferrin,gamma glutamyltransferase,mean corpuscular volume,receiver characteristic curve",gamma glutamyltransferase   ,"with PPV and ROC curve analysis .

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Representative sample of the residents of Greve in Chianti and Bagno a Ripoli, two small towns located in the Chianti geographic area (Tuscany, Italy). PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1,304 (age-range: 20-103, 79% aged> or =65) participants of the InCHIANTI study. MEASUREMENTS: CP seropositivity was assessed using immunofluorescence. Previous CPI was defined as immunoglobulin (Ig) G > or =1/16 and <1/256, and recent CPI was defined as IgG > or =1/512 or IgM > or =1/16. Inflammatory markers included interleukin (IL)-6, soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6r), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), iron, ferritin, and C-reactive protein (CRP). CV risk factors included smoking, body mass index (BMI), lipid profile, and hypertension. RESULTS: The prevalence of CP seropositivity was 75%, increased with age, and was higher in men than in women (P<.01).

Patients with a decreased functional status are prone to have malnutrition which negatively affects their prognosis and increases mortality. However, it is unclear whether functional and nutritional status are independent risk factors of mortality. PATIENTS AND METHOD: We investigated the relation between functional status (Katz index) and nutritional parameters and the incidence of mortality in a prospective, observational study of a cohort of elderly patients who were admitted to an internal medicine ward. Prevalence of malnutrition upon admission and cumulative incidence rate of in-hospital mortality were computed. Also, potential nutritional and functional prognostic factors for in-hospital mortality were identified by multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: The prevalence of malnutrition in 105 patients included in the cohort was 57.1% (95 percent confidence interval, 47.1% to 66.8%). The incidence of in-hospital mortality was 14.3% (95 percent confidence interval, 8.2% to 22.5%). After adjustment, independent prognostic factors for in-hospital mortality were: a high level of functional dependence (F and G categories of Katz index, OR 6.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 26.3), diminished levels of serum transferrin (each decrement of 1g/L, OR 8.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 3.4 to 20.0) and lymphocyte cell counts (each decrement of 0.5 x 10(9) cells/L, OR 2.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 3.5). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of malnutrition and the incidence of mortality are very high in the hospitalized elderly. In our cohort, decreased serum transferrin and lymphocyte cell count, and an increased level of functional status were associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the same iron load administered in different regimens on anemia, iron status and the reticulocyte (Ret) subpopulation patterns in stable patients on chronic hemodialysis (HD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients undergoing thrice-weekly chronic HD and receiving stable alphaerythropoietin therapy with absolute iron deficiency (transferrin saturation (TSAT) <20%, ferritin (Frt) <100 ng/mL) were randomly divided into two groups: group A (n=9) received 20.8 mg of sodium iron gluconate at the end of each dialysis session; group B (n=8) 62.5 mg only at the end of the 1st dialysis session of the week. The treatment period lasted 3 months (period 1) and was followed by 3 months of observation (period 2). RESULTS: Both treatments increased hemoglobin (Hb) levels by an average of 0.90 g/dL in period 1, with a progressive decline in period 2 (p=ns between groups), peaking at 11.2 g/dL in group A and 10.8 g/dL in group B. The effects on mean red blood cell volume and Hb concentrations were similar. Frt levels more than doubled during period 1 and early in period 2 in both groups (172 microg/L in group A; 149 microg/L in group B, and progressively decreased in period 2 (p=ns between groups). The TSAT index increased progressively peaking to 28.7% in group A and 24.3% in group B. Hypochromic red blood cells (hypocRBC) decreased early from 5.6-2.2% in group A, and from 5.5-2.1% in group B, and persisted in period 2; the between-period differences for the combined groups were statistically significant (p=0.0051). High fluorescence reticulocytes (HFR) increased from period 1 to period 2 only in group B (from 0.8-1.7%, p=0.012). CONCLUSIONS: Both regimens replenished iron stores and improved anemia. The HFR increase in group B could be due to soluble transferring receptor (STnfR) gene upregulation; alternatively it could indicate the prevalence of immature Ret release from bone marrow.","immature ret release, bone, chronic hemodialysis,transferrin saturation,high fluorescence reticulocytes,",chronic hemodialysis patients: ,"reticulocytes ( HFR ) increased from period 1 to period 2 only in group B ( from 0.8-1.7 % , p = 0.012 ) .

","Cardiovacular disease is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. However, there are no reliable data neither on the prevalence of cardiovacular disease nor its risk factors in Spain. The Morbidity and mortality Anemia Renal study (MAR) is a two-year multicenter, open-label, prospective cohorts study. Its main objective is to assess the general morbidity and mortality, particularly of a cardiovascular cause, and its relationship with the degree of anemia. Secondary objectives are: a/ the description of current clinical practices in anemia, dialysis, vascular access, and CV risk factor management; and b/ the description of hospitalization and mortality causes. This paper describes the prevalence of cardiovascular disease and risk factors of the HD population in Spain. A total of 1.710 patients were included (60% male, aged 64.4 years, 16.2 months on HD). The mean co-morbidity Charlson index was 6.5 +/- 2.3. Cardiovascular disease was the most prevalent comorbidity, 16.7% had a coronary disease, and 13.9% had different degrees of heart failure, while 11.6% had arrhythmia, 1.7% stroke and 5.5% peripheral artery disease. The prevalence of hypertension was 75.8%, 74.4% of patients received antihypertensive drugs, and still 40% of patients had an inadequate blood pressure control. The investigators considered as dyslipidemic 34.1% of patients, and prescribed treatment to 69.5% of them, while the remaining 30.5% (10.4% of the total) had hyperlipidemia with no drug therapy. Eleven percent was active smoker, and 26.6% former smoker. There was 47.4% of patients with a corporal mass index above 25.

","Cardiovacular disease is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. However, there are no reliable data neither on the prevalence of cardiovacular disease nor its risk factors in Spain. The Morbidity and mortality Anemia Renal study (MAR) is a two-year multicenter, open-label, prospective cohorts study. Its main objective is to assess the general morbidity and mortality, particularly of a cardiovascular cause, and its relationship with the degree of anemia. Secondary objectives are: a/ the description of current clinical practices in anemia, dialysis, vascular access, and CV risk factor management; and b/ the description of hospitalization and mortality causes. This paper describes the prevalence of cardiovascular disease and risk factors of the HD population in Spain. A total of 1.710 patients were included (60% male, aged 64.4 years, 16.2 months on HD). The mean co-morbidity Charlson index was 6.5 +/- 2.3. Cardiovascular disease was the most prevalent comorbidity, 16.7% had a coronary disease, and 13.9% had different degrees of heart failure, while 11.6% had arrhythmia, 1.7% stroke and 5.5% peripheral artery disease. The prevalence of hypertension was 75.8%, 74.4% of patients received antihypertensive drugs, and still 40% of patients had an inadequate blood pressure control.

","Cardiovacular disease is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. However, there are no reliable data neither on the prevalence of cardiovacular disease nor its risk factors in Spain. The Morbidity and mortality Anemia Renal study (MAR) is a two-year multicenter, open-label, prospective cohorts study. Its main objective is to assess the general morbidity and mortality, particularly of a cardiovascular cause, and its relationship with the degree of anemia. Secondary objectives are: a/ the description of current clinical practices in anemia, dialysis, vascular access, and CV risk factor management; and b/ the description of hospitalization and mortality causes. This paper describes the prevalence of cardiovascular disease and risk factors of the HD population in Spain. A total of 1.710 patients were included (60% male, aged 64.4 years, 16.2 months on HD). The mean co-morbidity Charlson index was 6.5 +/- 2.3. Cardiovascular disease was the most prevalent comorbidity, 16.7% had a coronary disease, and 13.9% had different degrees of heart failure, while 11.6% had arrhythmia, 1.7% stroke and 5.5% peripheral artery disease.

We conducted this study to investigate whether there is an association between body iron status and clinical outcome in patients with coronary artery disease after coronary stenting. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study included 664 patients with coronary artery disease who underwent coronary stent implantation. The soluble transferring receptor/ferritin ratio (sTfR/ferritin ratio) was used as an index of iron status. Patients were divided into three groups according to the tertiles of sTfR/ferritin ratio: lower tertile (<11.9; n = 221), middle tertile (11.9-27.8; n = 221) and upper tertile (>27.8; n = 222). The combined incidence of major adverse cardiac events (death, myocardial infarction and target vessel revascularization) was the primary end point of the study. Patients in the lower tertile of the sTfR/ferritin ratio presented more often with unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction and had longer lesions and higher grade of stenosis than the patients in the middle or upper tertile of the sTfR/ferritin ratio. Angiographic restenosis at 6-month angiography was also evaluated. The cumulative event rate of composite end point of death, myocardial infarction or target vessel revascularization was 27.6% in patients in the lower tertile, 24.4% in patients in the middle tertile and 28.4% in patients in the upper tertile of the sTfR/ferritin ratio (p = 0.68). Restenosis was found in 27.8% (n = 45) in the lower tertile, 25.8% (n = 42) in the middle tertile and 27.5% (n = 38) in the upper tertile of the sTfR/ferritin ratio (p = 0.90).

We conducted this study to investigate whether there is an association between body iron status and clinical outcome in patients with coronary artery disease after coronary stenting. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study included 664 patients with coronary artery disease who underwent coronary stent implantation. The soluble transferring receptor/ferritin ratio (sTfR/ferritin ratio) was used as an index of iron status. Patients were divided into three groups according to the tertiles of sTfR/ferritin ratio: lower tertile (<11.9; n = 221), middle tertile (11.9-27.8; n = 221) and upper tertile (>27.8; n = 222).

74,16467042_1,16467042, Epidemiology and outcome of adult-onset Still's disease in Northern Norway. ,"BACKGROUND: Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is considered a rare disease, but few data exist on the incidence and prevalence of AOSD. This study has analysed the epidemiology, disease presentation, and outcome of AOSD in a stable homogeneous population in Northern Norway. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of all AOSD patients registered in 1990-2000 at the only hospital in the region with a Rheumatology Service. Clinical diagnosis and exclusion of patients were directed by the Yamaguchi criteria for AOSD. Demographic and clinical data at baseline were extracted from patient records and supplemented with data gathered at control visits. Data were analysed with nonparametric methods. RESULTS: AOSD was ascertained in 13 patients; the estimated annual AOSD incidence was 0.4/100,000 adults (95% CI 0.11-0.97), while point prevalence of AOSD increased from 3.4/100,000 (95% CI 0.8-9.4) in 1990 to 6.9/100,000 in 2000 (95% CI 2.7-14.2). Mean diagnostic delay was 5.2 months (range 0.5-18). Serum ferritin > 5 times the normal upper level had 63% diagnostic sensitivity. During 69 months' follow-up, one patient died, 6/13 patients achieved sustained remission, while six patients developed a chronic progressive (n = 3) or a relapsing/remitting disease course (n = 3). Four of these six patents had to enter social security programmes. CONCLUSION: The annual incidence of AOSD in Northern Norway is at least 0.4/100,000 adults. AOSD in this region is more prevalent than in France or Japan, affects more males, and approximates to the prevalence of juvenile Still's disease. Half of all patients have a monocyclic disease course, while mortality and invalidity occur in patients with chronic disease.","onset stills disease increased,  adult onset stills disease,",northern norway  ,"adults ( 95 % CI 0.11-0.97 ) , while point prevalence of AOSD increased from 3.4 / 100,000 ( 95 % CI 0.8-9.4 ) in 1990 to 6.9 / 100,000 in 2000 ( 95 % CI 2.7-14.2 ) .

","OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this subanalysis was to examine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of terbinafine in the treatment of toenail onychomycosis in the patients aged > or = 65 years in the Improving Results in Onychomycosis Concomitant Lamisil And Debridement (IRON-CLAD) trial. (Lamisil and IRON-CLAD are trademarks of Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, New Jersey.) The secondary objective was to determine if toenail debridement would provide additional efficacy benefits in this subgroup. METHODS: The IRON-CLAD trial was an open-label, randomized, multicenter study of adults who underwent 4 weeks of screening and received terbinafine 250 mg/d for 12 weeks with or without aggressive toenail debridement (at baseline and weeks 6, 12, and 24). Clinic visits occurred at weeks 6, 12, 24, and 48. Safety and tolerability were assessed by adverse event (AE) rates based on changes in laboratory values, patient-volunteered information, answers to investigator questions, and physical examinations. Efficacy was evaluated by mycologic cure (negative microscopy of potassium hydroxide samples and negative culture), clinical cure (> or = 87.5% nail clearing), and complete cure (mycologic cure and complete toenail clearing) at week 48. The present subanalysis of IRON-CLAD results assessed participants aged > or = 65 years (older subgroup). RESULTS: A total of 504 patients were randomized, of whom 75 were aged > or = 65 years. In the older subgroup, the mean (SD) age was 68.9 (3.04), 86.7% (65/75) were white, and 66.7% (50/75) were male. Incidence of AEs reported during the treatment period or within 30 days after treatment discontinuation (treatment-emergent AEs [TEAEs]) was 28.0% in the older subgroup and 23.0% in the overall study population. Most TEAEs were mild (73.7%) to moderate (23.7%) in severity, and most (86.8%) were not suspected by the investigators to be related to study treatment. The most frequently occurring TEAEs in the older subgroup were nausea (4.0%), sinusitis (4.0%) arthralgia (2.7%), and hypercholesterolemia (2.7%). The proportion of participants who withdrew from the trial due to TEAEs was 4.0% (3/75) in the older group and 2.8% (14/504) in the overall population. Only 3 of 11 discontinuations in the older subgroup were due to a TEAE suspected by the investigator to be related to study treatment. Sixty-four percent of the older subgroup took antihypertensive medications, 25% took antidiabetics, and 47% took antilipemic medications. There were no clinical signs of drug interactions in the older subgroup. Clinical efficacy outcomes in the older subgroup were generally good and appeared to be comparable with those in the younger subgroup. At week 48, mycologic cure had occurred in 64.0% (95% CI, 53.1%-74.9%) of the older subgroup, clinical cure in 41.3% (95% CI, 30.2%-52.5%), and complete cure in 28.0% (95% CI, 17.8%-38.2%). Debridement did not appear to affect mycologic outcomes or clinical effectiveness, but rates of clinical and complete cure appeared to be higher among older patients who underwent adjuvant debridement. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this subanalysis suggest that terbinafine was well tolerated and efficacious in these patients aged > or = 65 years with moderate to severe toenail onychomycosis, many of whom were taking antihypertensives, antidiabetics, or lipid-lowering agents concomitantly.

In the older subgroup, the mean (SD) age was 68.9 (3.04), 86.7% (65/75) were white, and 66.7% (50/75) were male. Incidence of AEs reported during the treatment period or within 30 days after treatment discontinuation (treatment-emergent AEs [TEAEs]) was 28.0% in the older subgroup and 23.0% in the overall study population. Most TEAEs were mild (73.7%) to moderate (23.7%) in severity, and most (86.8%) were not suspected by the investigators to be related to study treatment. The most frequently occurring TEAEs in the older subgroup were nausea (4.0%), sinusitis (4.0%) arthralgia (2.7%), and hypercholesterolemia (2.7%). The proportion of participants who withdrew from the trial due to TEAEs was 4.0% (3/75) in the older group and 2.8% (14/504) in the overall population. Only 3 of 11 discontinuations in the older subgroup were due to a TEAE suspected by the investigator to be related to study treatment. Sixty-four percent of the older subgroup took antihypertensive medications, 25% took antidiabetics, and 47% took antilipemic medications. There were no clinical signs of drug interactions in the older subgroup. Clinical efficacy outcomes in the older subgroup were generally good and appeared to be comparable with those in the younger subgroup. At week 48, mycologic cure had occurred in 64.0% (95% CI, 53.1%-74.9%) of the older subgroup, clinical cure in 41.3% (95% CI, 30.2%-52.5%), and complete cure in 28.0% (95% CI, 17.8%-38.2%). Debridement did not appear to affect mycologic outcomes or clinical effectiveness, but rates of clinical and complete cure appeared to be higher among older patients who underwent adjuvant debridement. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this subanalysis suggest that terbinafine was well tolerated and efficacious in these patients aged > or = 65 years with moderate to severe toenail onychomycosis, many of whom were taking antihypertensives, antidiabetics, or lipid-lowering agents concomitantly.

We compared traditional and uremia-related cardiovascular risk factors in HD patients stratified according to their body mass index (BMI). METHODS: One hundred sixteen HD patients were stratified into 4 groups according to the BMI: underweight (<18.5), normal weight (18.5-24.9), overweight (25.0-29.9) and obese (> or =30). Blood samples were obtained before the HD session to measure serum albumin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, ferritin, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein B-100, apolipoprotein B (apoB) to apolipoprotein A (apoA) ratio and Lp(a) lipoprotein. RESULTS: There were 3 underweight (excluded from the analysis), 58 normal weight, 35 overweight and 20 obese patients. Their mean age was 62.1 +/- 14.1 years. There were 68 men and 45 women. Mean dialytic age was 5.32 +/- 3.2 years. The mean BMI of the study population was 25.2 +/- 4.1. The prevalence of smoking habit was similar in the 3 groups (17.2%, 8.5% and 25%, respectively; p=0.28). The prevalence of hypertension was higher in overweight (77.1%) and obese (65%) patients than in leaner counterparts (53.4%), although the difference was not significant. Conversely, diabetes prevalence was significantly higher in overweight and obese patients (22.8% and 30%, respectively) than in normal weight patients (6.9%; p=0.02). The serum levels of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, Lp(a) lipoprotein, apolipoprotein A-I, apolipoprotein B-100, and apoA/apoB ratio were similar in the 3 BMI groups.

We compared traditional and uremia-related cardiovascular risk factors in HD patients stratified according to their body mass index (BMI). METHODS: One hundred sixteen HD patients were stratified into 4 groups according to the BMI: underweight (<18.5), normal weight (18.5-24.9), overweight (25.0-29.9) and obese (> or =30). Blood samples were obtained before the HD session to measure serum albumin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, ferritin, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein B-100, apolipoprotein B (apoB) to apolipoprotein A (apoA) ratio and Lp(a) lipoprotein. RESULTS: There were 3 underweight (excluded from the analysis), 58 normal weight, 35 overweight and 20 obese patients. Their mean age was 62.1 +/- 14.1 years. There were 68 men and 45 women. Mean dialytic age was 5.32 +/- 3.2 years. The mean BMI of the study population was 25.2 +/- 4.1. The prevalence of smoking habit was similar in the 3 groups (17.2%, 8.5% and 25%, respectively; p=0.28).

Most of the uremia-related cardiovascular risk factors (anemia, hyperparathyroidism, chronic inflammation) were comparable among BMI categories as well as the levels of C-reactive protein, fibrinogen and ferritin.

90,18675097_1,18675097, Effects of everolimus monotherapy on hematological parameters and iron homeostasis in de novo liver transplant recipients: preliminary results. ,"INTRODUCTION: Anemia after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is a common complication due to several reasons. Immunosuppressive drugs play an important role in anemia occurring at 1 month or more after OLT. Several studies describe myelosuppression immunosuppressants such as the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors. METHODS: We performed a single-center, prospective trial consisting of a short 30-day course of cyclosporine (CsA) associated with everolimus (EVL) from postoperative day 10 (Group EVL) versus a CsA immunosuppressive regimen (Group CsA) in de novo OLT patients. We explored the influence of immunosuppressive drugs on hematological parameters comparing EVL versus CsA. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were enrolled in the EVL and 12 in the CsA Groups. After OLT, hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), white blood cell (WBC), platelets (PLT), transferrin saturation (TSAT), iron, ferritin, and transferrin did not differ significantly between the 2 groups at any time point. Among the patients who reached 6-months of follow-up, 5 (41.7%) EVL and 4 (80%) CsA subjects were anemic (P=not significant [NS]). Only anemia in patients enrolled in Group EVL showed a trend toward the features of microcytic, hypochromic anemia. DISCUSSION: Our results demonstrated that de novo anemia in OLT patients treated with EVL monotherapy showed the same incidence as in patients treated with CsA. Hb values remained similar during the entire follow-up. Moreover, overall myelosuppression in the EVL Group was not significantly different from patients in the CsA Group.","everolimus monotherapy, orthotopic liver transplantation,associated, everolimus,mean corpuscular volume,mean corpuscular hemoglobin",de novo liver transplant recipients  anemia  patients,"EVL and 4 ( 80 % ) CsA subjects were anemic ( P = not significant [ NS ] ) .

This paper summarizes the baseline characteristics of this population. METHODS: A prospective, observational, one-cohort study, including all consecutive incident haemodialysis patients from 147 Spanish nephrology services, was conducted. Patients were enrolled between October 2003 and September 2004. Sociodemographic, clinical, laboratory and health care characteristics were collected. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics are described for 2341 incident haemodialysis patients [mean (SD) age 65.2 (14.5) years, 63% males]. The main cause of renal failure was diabetic nephropathy (26%). The majority of patients (57%) had a Karnofsky score of 80-100 and 27% were followed up by a nephrologist for <or=6 months. In total, 86% of the patients had hypertension, 43% had dyslipidaemia and 44% had a history of cardiovascular disease. Initial vascular access was obtained via a temporary catheter in 30% of patients, via a permanent catheter in 16% and via an arteriovenous fistula in 54%. Albumin levels were <3.5 g/dl in 43% of patients. Immediately prior to the onset of haemodialysis, the mean (SD) glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 7.6 (2.8) ml/min/1.73 m(2), and only 6.7% of the patients were within the K/DOQI guidelines for all four bone mineral markers.

100,19101240_1,19101240, Relation of serum ferritin level to cardiovascular fitness among young men. ,"Although iron overload is associated with fatigue and low ferritin is associated with decreased cardiovascular fitness (CVF), little research has focused on the relation of elevated ferritin with CVF in young adult men. An analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002 was conducted to examine the relation between elevated ferritin and CVF in relatively healthy young adult men. Adult men aged 20 to 49 years (unweighted n = 1,030, weighted n = 28,514,823) who participated in a treadmill test for CVF were evaluated. Logistic regressions were computed for ferritin with CVF, adjusting for age, race or ethnicity, body mass index, anemia, smoking, exercise, blood donation, and C-reactive protein. Subjects with ferritin >300 ng/ml were less likely than those with normal ferritin to have high CVF (odds ratio [OR] 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32 to 0.99). When ferritin was split into categories, in a fully adjusted model with a reference group of ferritin at 16 to 100 ng/ml, except for ferritin >100 but <150 ng/ml (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.08), higher ferritin was associated with a decreased likelihood of high CVF (>150 but <200 ng/ml: OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.77; >200 but <300 ng/ml: OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.72; >300 ng/ml: OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.70). The prevalence of ferritin >150 ng/ml was 45.5% in young adult men.

METHODS: 38 anemic CHF-CRF patients were treated with subcutaneous Erythropoietin (EPO) and intravenous (IV) iron over 1 year. They were questioned initially and at 3 months post treatment about symptoms of RLS according to standard criteria. They were also contacted by telephone about RLS symptoms 12 months after onset of anemia treatment. RESULTS: RLS was found in 15 (39.5%) of the 38 patients. In 10 (66.7%) patients it was present at least 6 days a week. The prevalence of the RLS initially was not related to Hb, to serum iron or % Transferrin Saturation.

111,19426168_1,19426168, Cost-effectiveness of screening for unhealthy alcohol use with % carbohydrate deficient transferrin: results from a literature-based decision analytic computer model. ,"BACKGROUND: The %carbohydrate deficient transferrin (%CDT) test offers objective evidence of unhealthy alcohol use but its cost-effectiveness in primary care conditions is unknown. METHODS: Using a decision tree and Markov model, we performed a literature-based cost-effectiveness analysis of 4 strategies for detecting unhealthy alcohol use in adult primary care patients: (i) Questionnaire Only, using a validated 3-item alcohol questionnaire; (ii) %CDT Only; (iii) Questionnaire followed by %CDT (Questionnaire-%CDT) if the questionnaire is negative; and (iv) No Screening. For those patients screening positive, clinicians performed more detailed assessment to characterize unhealthy use and determine therapy. We estimated costs using Medicare reimbursement and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. We determined sensitivity, specificity, prevalence of disease, and mortality from the medical literature. In the base case, we calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in 2006 dollars per quality-adjusted life year ($/QALY) for a 50-year-old cohort. RESULTS: In the base case, the ICER for the Questionnaire-%CDT strategy was $15,500/QALY compared with the Questionnaire Only strategy. Other strategies were dominated. When the prevalence of unhealthy alcohol use exceeded 15% and screening age was <60 years, the Questionnaire-%CDT strategy costs less than $50,000/QALY compared to the Questionnaire Only strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Adding %CDT to questionnaire-based screening for unhealthy alcohol use was cost-effective in our literature-based decision analytic model set in typical primary care conditions. Screening with %CDT should be considered for adults up to the age of 60 when the prevalence of unhealthy alcohol use is 15% or more and screening questionnaires are negative.","unhealthy alcohol use exceeded 15, incremental cost effectiveness ratio,", ,"( ICER ) in 2006 dollars per quality-adjusted life year ( $ / QALY ) for a 50-year-old cohort .

This may be caused by hemodilution, which is typical among athletes, or by reduced body iron stores. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of iron-deficiency anemia in recruits to the Israel Defense Force after 6 months of training. METHODS: Blood was collected from recruits before training. After 6 months of follow-up, 153 paired blood samples were collected from the initial cohort. Total blood count and serum iron, transferrin, and ferritin were measured at both time points. Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) was measured in 119 of the paired samples and the sTfR/log ferritin ratio was calculated. RESULTS: At recruitment, mean hemoglobin concentration was 14.7 +/- .9 g/dl. Iron-transferrin saturation was 34.1% +/- 13.6%, and mean ferritin concentration was 53.6 +/- 33.2 ng/ml. Anemia prevalence (Hb <14 g/dl) was 17.6%, and 14.9% of participants were iron-deficient (ferritin <22 mg/dl). At 6 months, 50.3% of the cohort was anemic, and 27.3% demonstrated iron-store depletion. Paired analysis showed an average reduction of .83 g/dl in hemoglobin (p < .001), and of 9.8 mg/dl in ferritin (p < .001). sTfR increased from 1.9 to 2.1 mg/dl (p < .003) among recruits who became anemic.

This may be caused by hemodilution, which is typical among athletes, or by reduced body iron stores. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of iron-deficiency anemia in recruits to the Israel Defense Force after 6 months of training. METHODS: Blood was collected from recruits before training. After 6 months of follow-up, 153 paired blood samples were collected from the initial cohort.

","AIM: Chronic inflammation, which is common in dialysis patients, often causes malnutrition and even protein-energy wasting. However, the association of high-calcium dialysate with malnutrition and/or inflammation in non-diabetic maintenance haemodialysis patients remains unclear. This study investigated the possible adverse effects of high-calcium dialysate and mortality in this population. METHODS: A total of 717 non-diabetic haemodialysis patients participated in this 2 year prospective study. The subjects were categorized into three subgroups based on whether dialysate calcium concentrations were high (3.5 mEq/L), standard (3.0 mEq/L) or low (2.5 mEq/L). Demographic, haematological, nutritional and inflammatory markers, biochemical and dialysis-related data were obtained for cross-sectional analysis. Causes of death and mortality rates were also analyzed for each subgroup. RESULTS: Patients with high-calcium dialysate (n = 82) had a higher incidence of malnutrition and inflammation (61.0% vs 44.1% and 43.9%, respectively) than those with standard- and low-calcium dialysate (n = 528 and 107). Backward stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that high-calcium dialysate was negatively correlated with nutritional index, serum albumin levels, but positively associated with the inflammatory marker of serum ferritin levels. At the end of the 2 year follow up, 45 patients had died. Cox multivariate analysis demonstrated that high-calcium dialysate was a significant associated factor (relative risk 2.765; 95% confidence interval 1.429-5.352) for 2 year all-cause mortality in these patients. CONCLUSION: The analytical results indicate that high-calcium dialysate is associated with malnutrition and inflammation as well as 2 year mortality in non-diabetic maintenance haemodialysis patients and the findings suggest that this population, even those with optimal mineral balance, should avoid high-calcium dialysate.","malnutrition, inflammation",non diabetic maintenance haemo patients  high calcium dialysate ,"low ( 2.5 mEq / L ) .

The association between ferritin and cardiovascular disease is poorly documented in cardiometabolic states with higher cardiovascular risk, such as diabetes and metabolic syndrome. We therefore characterized a cohort of males with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) according to ferritin levels and prevalent macroangiopathy. METHODS: The presence of overall macroangiopathy, peripheral and/or coronary artery disease was documented in 424 consecutive T2DM males, who were divided according to ferritin quartiles (Q) as follows: QI-III, normal ferritin (NF; n=318), mean+/-1 sd ferritin 133+/-72 ng/ml; and QIV patients, high ferritin (HF; n=106), ferritin 480+/-228 ng/ml. RESULTS: Age, age at diabetes diagnosis, smoking, ethanol intake, body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure and presence of metabolic syndrome did not differ between groups. However, the prevalence of macroangiopathy was unexpectedly much lower in patients with high ferritin, as follows: 25% vs. 43% for overall macroangiopathy; 7% vs. 16% for peripheral artery disease; and 16% vs. 31% for coronary artery disease (P=0.0009, P=0.0140 and P=0.0035, respectively, vs. NF patients). Insulin resistance index and prevalence of liver steatosis were higher in HF compared with NF patients as follows: 2.17% vs. 1.89% and 78% vs. 64% (P=0.0345 and P=0.0059, respectively). Liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase) were significantly higher in HF, by 33%, 42% and 72%, respectively (all P<0.0002), suggesting a higher prevalence of steatohepatitis. Glycated haemoglobin, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, triglycerides, urate, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and albuminuria were not different between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that T2DM males with high ferritin levels exhibit a markedly decreased prevalence of macroangiopathy, despite more severe insulin resistance and higher markers of steatohepatitis.

The association between ferritin and cardiovascular disease is poorly documented in cardiometabolic states with higher cardiovascular risk, such as diabetes and metabolic syndrome. We therefore characterized a cohort of males with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) according to ferritin levels and prevalent macroangiopathy. METHODS: The presence of overall macroangiopathy, peripheral and/or coronary artery disease was documented in 424 consecutive T2DM males, who were divided according to ferritin quartiles (Q) as follows: QI-III, normal ferritin (NF; n=318), mean+/-1 sd ferritin 133+/-72 ng/ml; and QIV patients, high ferritin (HF; n=106), ferritin 480+/-228 ng/ml. RESULTS: Age, age at diabetes diagnosis, smoking, ethanol intake, body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure and presence of metabolic syndrome did not differ between groups. However, the prevalence of macroangiopathy was unexpectedly much lower in patients with high ferritin, as follows: 25% vs. 43% for overall macroangiopathy; 7% vs. 16% for peripheral artery disease; and 16% vs. 31% for coronary artery disease (P=0.0009, P=0.0140 and P=0.0035, respectively, vs. NF patients).

138,20536513_9,20536513, Do high ferritin levels confer lower cardiovascular risk in men with Type 2 diabetes? ,"AIMS: High ferritin levels are associated with insulin resistance and liver steatosis, both thought of as emerging cardiovascular risk factors. The association between ferritin and cardiovascular disease is poorly documented in cardiometabolic states with higher cardiovascular risk, such as diabetes and metabolic syndrome. We therefore characterized a cohort of males with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) according to ferritin levels and prevalent macroangiopathy. METHODS: The presence of overall macroangiopathy, peripheral and/or coronary artery disease was documented in 424 consecutive T2DM males, who were divided according to ferritin quartiles (Q) as follows: QI-III, normal ferritin (NF; n=318), mean+/-1 sd ferritin 133+/-72 ng/ml; and QIV patients, high ferritin (HF; n=106), ferritin 480+/-228 ng/ml. RESULTS: Age, age at diabetes diagnosis, smoking, ethanol intake, body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure and presence of metabolic syndrome did not differ between groups. However, the prevalence of macroangiopathy was unexpectedly much lower in patients with high ferritin, as follows: 25% vs. 43% for overall macroangiopathy; 7% vs. 16% for peripheral artery disease; and 16% vs. 31% for coronary artery disease (P=0.0009, P=0.0140 and P=0.0035, respectively, vs. NF patients). Insulin resistance index and prevalence of liver steatosis were higher in HF compared with NF patients as follows: 2.17% vs. 1.89% and 78% vs. 64% (P=0.0345 and P=0.0059, respectively).

Patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) are prone to develop iron deficiency (ID), and iron supplementation improves their functional status and quality of life. We sought to examine the relationship between ID and survival in patients with systolic CHF. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a prospective observational study, we evaluated 546 patients with stable systolic CHF [age: 55 +/- 11 (mean +/- standard deviation) years, males: 88%, left ventricular ejection fraction: 26 +/- 7%, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class (I/II/III/IV): 57/221/226/42]. Iron deficiency was defined as: ferritin <100 microg/L, or 100-300 microg/L with transferrin saturation <20%.

145,20702143_1,20702143, Anemia after bariatric surgery cannot be explained by iron deficiency alone: results of a large cohort study. ,"BACKGROUND: We sought to identify the frequency and mechanisms of anemia after bariatric surgery in a bariatric surgery program at the Medical College of Wisconsin, (Milwaukee, WI). Anemia after bariatric surgery has often been attributed to iron deficiency, although an inflammatory component might be present, making the anemia after surgery mechanistically complex. METHODS: The body mass index and hemoglobin (Hb), vitamin B(12), folate, iron, and ferritin levels were extracted from the records of 1125 patients for =4 years after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Anemia was defined using the World Health Organization criteria. RESULTS: The mean body mass index, Hb, and ferritin decreased after surgery. The body mass index decreased from 50.1 kg/m(2) (95% confidence interval [CI] 49.6-50.6) at baseline to 33.0 kg/m(2) (95% CI 32.3-33.6) at 12 months and remained unchanged thereafter.

A retrospective analysis. ,"BACKGROUND: Proliferation signal inhibitors may adversely impact bone marrow function. We sought to describe the impact of sirolimus on hemoglobin and erythropoiesis in heart transplant recipients. METHODS: We have conducted a single-center, retrospective analysis of all heart transplant patients treated with sirolimus. We measured serum hemoglobin (Hb) at baseline and at 3 months to determine the prevalence of anemia and change in Hb after sirolimus initiation. We also characterized hematologic profile of patients to gain insights into the effects of sirolimus on erythropoiesis. RESULTS: There were 84 patients included in the study. The prevalence of anemia increased from 71% to 75% after sirolimus initiation. Anemic patients were more likely to be male (P = .026) and have worse renal function (glomerular filtration rate 49  27 vs 70  42 mL/min; P = .012). A =20 g/L drop in Hb was observed in 25% of the overall cohort. Patients investigated for anemia (n = 67) had a low Hb (111  24 g/L), normal mean corpuscular volume (87  47 FL), and low serum iron levels (10  5 mol/L) and transferrin saturation (0.22  0.12). Serum ferritin was variable (263  370 g/L). Bone marrow evaluation in 19 patients revealed adequate marrow iron stores in all cases. CONCLUSION: Anemia is prevalent in heart transplant patients treated with sirolimus and increases over time.

Our previous survey in Beijing indicates that nephrotoxic medication use is independently associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: In the present study, the study population consisted of participants from our previous survey with a confirmed history of nephrotoxic medication use. Nephrotoxic mediations included three antipyretic analgesics (58.2%) and three Chinese traditional medicines containing aristolochic acids (CTM-AAs, 47.3%). Prevalence of CKD (defined by presence of albuminuria and/or reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate) as well as markers of tubular injury was analysed, and compared with 109 age- and sex-matched controls. RESULTS: The prevalence of CKD was higher among medication users compared with controls, which was 18.3% and 8.5%, respectively. Among participants with medication use without CKD, markers of tubular injury including N-acetyl--d-glucosaminidase, transferrin and a(1)-microglobulin, were present in 26.6%. CKD was associated with CTM-AA use (cumulative AA-I dose > 0.5 g, OR = 5.625, P < 0.05) and antipyretic analgesic use (cumulative dose > 2.0 kg, OR = 3.848, P = 0.063) in a dose-dependent manner.

153,21168677_1,21168677, Anemia in heart and kidney allograft recipients: is there a role for hepcidin? ,"The production by hepatocytes of hepcidin, a small defensin-like peptide, is modulated in response to anemia, hypoxia, or inflammation. We studied hepcidin as a marker of iron status (serum iron, ferritin, and soluble receptor of transferrin [sTfR], and as a marker of inflammation among 170 prevalent kidney transplantation (KT) patients and 168 prevalent orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) patients. In addition, we assessed the prevalence of anemia and its relation to measurements of hepcidin, sTfR, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Prevalence of anemia was 37% in KT patients and 34% in OHT patients according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) definition. Anemic KT patients displayed significantly higher values of serum creatinine, hepcidin, hsCRP, ferritin, and proteinuria associated with greater use of mTOR and significantly lower CSA therapy. The hemoglobin and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Upon multiple regression analysis eGFR, ferritin, and hsCRP independently predicted hepcidin levels, explaining 78% of the variation in hepcidin. Anemic OHT patients showed significantly lower GFR, red blood cell (RBC), and hemoglobin values and significantly higher creatinine and NT-proBNP content. Upon multiple regression analysis the predictors of serum hepcidin were eGFR and ferritin, which explained 68% of the variation in hepcidin. The prevalence of anemia is relatively high and not adequately treated (mainly due to reimbursement regulations) among heart and kidney allograft recipients. In conclusion, elevated hepcidin levels in heart and kidney transplant recipients suggest subclinical inflammation and impaired kidney function.","anemia,  relation,  kidney transplantation,orthotopic heart transplant,available enzyme linked immunosorbent assay,world health organisation",heart  kidney allograft rec  kidney transplantation patients,"inflammation among 170 prevalent kidney transplantation ( KT ) patients and 168 prevalent orthotopic heart transplant ( OHT ) patients .

","Pediatric vitamin and mineral supplements are thought to be used commonly in the United States, but details of their use are lacking. Using data from the Slone Survey (a cross-sectional national random-digit-dial medication use survey), this study sought to define the prevalence and patterns of use of supplemental vitamins, fluoride, and iron among US children younger than 12 years of age. Primary statistical analyses involved descriptive statistics and calculation of weighted prevalence of use estimates with 95% confidence intervals. Between February 1998 and April 2007, there were 2,857 children 0 to 11 years of age enrolled from the 48 contiguous United States with weighted prevalence of use of vitamins, iron, and fluoride as the primary outcome. The response rate to the survey was 61%. Overall, 23.1% of children had used a vitamin, fluoride, or iron supplement in the 7 days before the interview, with use being highest among 2- to 5-year-olds. Almost all vitamins and most fluoride and iron were taken in the form of multicomponent products. The most commonly taken specific vitamins were C, D, B-12, B-6, and B-2, each by >20% of children. Overall, 3.3% of study participants took supplemental fluoride and 9.7% took supplemental iron. In conclusion, this study found that almost one-quarter of US children younger than 12 years of age, and 30% of 2-year-olds, use supplemental vitamins, fluoride, and iron in a given week. These data should be combined with what is known about the need for pediatric supplementation with vitamins, fluoride, and iron to help clinicians and policy makers counsel parents about the optimal use of these products.","use, vitamins",fluoride  iron use among us ,"estimates with 95 % confidence intervals .

OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship of the physical activity level with cardiovascular risk factors and metabolic syndrome in 61 healthy men. METHODS: The short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) recommended by the World Health Organization was used as a valid measure to estimate two categories of physical activity, such as: low level (insufficient and sedentary) and vigorous level (moderate and very active). Cardiovascular risk factors and metabolic syndrome were defined according to criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program of the United States and International Diabetes Federation respectively. Serum levels of C-reactive protein and ferritin were also measured, and insulin sensitivity was estimated by the Homeostatic Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR). RESULTS: Mean age of study population was 47.1  6.9 years. 17 participants (28%) had metabolic syndrome. There were no differences between the categories of low and vigorous level physical activity, or relationship with total physical activity (MET  week).

However, little is known about the factors contributing to the development of TB-associated anemia and their importance in TB disease progression. Data from a randomized clinical trial of micronutrient supplementation in patients with pulmonary TB in Tanzania were analyzed. Repeated measures of anemia with iron deficiency, anemia without iron deficiency, and iron deficiency without anemia were assessed as risk factors for treatment failure, TB recurrence, and mortality. The prevalence of anemia (hemoglobin < 110 g/L) at baseline was 64%, more than one-half of which was related to iron deficiency (mean corpuscular volume , 80 fL). We found no evidence of an association between anemia (with or without iron deficiency) or iron deficiency without anemia at baseline and the risk of treatment failure at 1 mo after initiation. Anemia without iron deficiency was associated with an independent, 4-fold increased risk of TB recurrence [adjusted RR = 4.10 (95% CI = 1.88, 8.91); P < 0.001].

METHODS: A total of 785 Tanzanian children living in an area of intense malaria transmission were enrolled at birth, and intensively monitored for parasitemia and illness including malaria for up to 3 years, with an average of 47 blood smears. We assayed plasma samples collected at routine healthy-child visits, and evaluated the impact of iron deficiency (ID) on future malaria outcomes and mortality. RESULTS: ID at routine, well-child visits significantly decreased the odds of subsequent parasitemia (23% decrease, P < .001) and subsequent severe malaria (38% decrease, P = .04). ID was also associated with 60% lower all-cause mortality (P = .04) and 66% lower malaria-associated mortality (P = .11).

METHODS: 134 patients (68% on EPO at the beginning, increasing to 72.3% during follow-up) were monitored for 36 months. To evaluate the dose-response effect of EPO therapy, we used the erythropoietin resistance index (ERI) calculated as the weekly weight-adjusted dose of EPO divided by the haemoglobin level. The ERI was determined both initially and during the last six months before the end of the study. RESULTS: 39 patients (29.1%) had history of heart disease; 22 (16.4%) had suffered from heart failure (HF). The ERI was higher in patients with a history of heart disease or HF and those treated with drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin system (ACE inhibitors or ARBs). Using ERI as the dependent variable in the multivariate analysis, the variables that composed the final model were ferritin, haemoglobin, glomerular filtration rate and history of HF. The 36 month mortality rate (n=39 patients) was higher in the group having ERI above the median (2.6IU/week/kg/gram of haemoglobin in 100ml) (P=.002), and in the groups with heart disease (P=.001) or HF (P=.001) according to the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with history of heart disease or HF have a higher ERI, and all of these characteristics are associated with lower survival.

Iron-deficiency anemia is described to be a common problem in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which is frequently associated with a reduced quality of life. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in a population-based cohort at time of first diagnosis and during the early course of the disease. Methods. As far as available, lab values of patients registered in the population-based ""Oberpfalz cohort"" were screened. In anemic patients, we further investigated all laboratory results to differentiate between iron deficiency and other reasons for anemia. All patients with any kind of anemia were interviewed separately according to symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia and administration of iron. Results. In total, we evaluated hemoglobin values of 279 patients (183 Crohn's disease, 90 ulcerative colitis, and 6 indeterminate colitis). Lab data which allowed further differentiation of the type of anemia were available in 70% of anemic patients, in 34.4% values of iron, ferritin and transferrin saturation had been measured. At time of first diagnosis, an iron-deficiency anemia was diagnosed in 26 of 68 patients with anemia (38.2%, 20 CD, 4 UC, and 2 IC patients), but only 9 patients (34.6%) received subsequent iron therapy. After one year, 27 patients were identified to have an iron-deficiency anemia (19 CD, 8 UC), 20 of them were treated with iron (71.4%). Of 9 patients with proven iron-deficiency anemia at time of first diagnosis and subsequent administration of iron, 5 (55.5%) had iron-deficiency anemia despite permanent treatment after one year. In total, 38 patients (54.3%) did not receive any iron substitution at all despite of proven iron-deficiency anemia, and only 13 patients of 74 patients were treated with intravenous iron (17.6%). Conclusion. We found a high prevalence of iron-deficiency anemia at different points during the early course of disease in this population-based cohort of IBD patients. Surprisingly, only in one-third of patients with proven anemia, further diagnostic approach was undertaken.

In total, we evaluated hemoglobin values of 279 patients (183 Crohn's disease, 90 ulcerative colitis, and 6 indeterminate colitis). Lab data which allowed further differentiation of the type of anemia were available in 70% of anemic patients, in 34.4% values of iron, ferritin and transferrin saturation had been measured. At time of first diagnosis, an iron-deficiency anemia was diagnosed in 26 of 68 patients with anemia (38.2%, 20 CD, 4 UC, and 2 IC patients), but only 9 patients (34.6%) received subsequent iron therapy. After one year, 27 patients were identified to have an iron-deficiency anemia (19 CD, 8 UC), 20 of them were treated with iron (71.4%). Of 9 patients with proven iron-deficiency anemia at time of first diagnosis and subsequent administration of iron, 5 (55.5%) had iron-deficiency anemia despite permanent treatment after one year. In total, 38 patients (54.3%) did not receive any iron substitution at all despite of proven iron-deficiency anemia, and only 13 patients of 74 patients were treated with intravenous iron (17.6%).

Iron-deficiency anemia is described to be a common problem in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which is frequently associated with a reduced quality of life. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in a population-based cohort at time of first diagnosis and during the early course of the disease. Methods.

Late complications (LCs) are all events occurring beyond two years post-HSCT. We retrospectively analyzed prevalence, factors influencing occurrence, and prognosis of LCs post-HSCT for HGP. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2000 and 2011, 47 patients (21 males, 26 females; 43 with beta thalassemia major, four with sickle cell disease) who had survived more than two years post-HSCT for HGP were retrospectively reviewed. Mean age at HSCT was 7.7 years (1.1-32 years); mean follow-up was 7.1 years (2-11.6 years); 11 patients were splenectomized; mean ferritin level was 3022 ng/mL (350-10900); and seven patients underwent a second HSCT. RESULTS: Endocrinological complications were observed with primary gonadal failure in 16/20 mature females and 4/11 mature males, in five patients with primary hypothyroidism and in four with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (DM). Skeletal complications were observed in 10 with secondary osteoporosis; 22 patients had elevated transaminase levels; two had hepatitis B reactivation.

181,23352175_1,23352175, Iron deficiency is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in the elderly living in long-term care facilities. ,"OBJECTIVE: The association between serum iron status, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and all-cause mortality remains controversial in the elderly. In the present study, we aim to determine the relevance of serum iron level on the incidences of CVD and all-cause mortality in an elderly population. METHODS: A baseline cohort of 336 participants, aged =65 y, was recruited from eight long-term care facilities between 2002 and 2003. The degree of iron deficiency was defined based on the serum iron level (mild: 40 mg/dL =serum iron <60 mg/dL; severe: serum iron <40 mg/dL). Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were adopted to evaluate the relative risks (RRs) of CVD and all-cause death. Taiwan's Department of Health provided the mortality data. RESULTS: There were 210 deaths during a 5-y follow-up period, 62 of which were due to CVD. The prevalence of iron deficiency among the subjects was 50.3%. Age, sex, body mass index, waist circumference, mean arterial pressure, performance status, lifestyle factors, blood glucose, hemoglobin, lipid, albumin, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein levels were adjusted to compare the RRs of the subjects. The RRs (95% confidence interval) of CVD and all-cause mortality among mildly iron-deficient subjects were 1.08 (0.51-2.29) and 1.63 (1.14-2.31), respectively, and 2.77 (1.28-5.99) and 1.96 (1.26-3.04), respectively, among severely iron-deficient subjects. The severity of iron deficiency was positively associated with CVD and all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that iron deficiency is independently associated with CVD and all-cause mortality in elderly Taiwanese living in long-term care facilities.","iron deficiency among, subjects, cardiovascular disease,", elderly living  long ter ,".

182,23375326_1,23375326," Iron metabolism, hepcidin, and anemia in orthotopic heart transplantation recipients treated with mammalian target of rapamycin. ","PURPOSE: Functional iron deficiency is characterized by the presence of adequate stores as defined by conventional criteria, but with the inability to sufficiently mobilize iron for erythropoiesis. Hepcidin, produced by hepatocytes in response to anemia, hypoxia, or inflammation, is a key regulator of iron homeostasis. Anemia is relatively common among patients treated with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) antagonists. We tested hypothesis that hepcidin was related to the functional iron deficiency, defined as a ferritin value above 200 ng/mL with transform saturation (TSAT) below 20% among orthotopic heart transplant recipients (OHT) treated (n = 35) versus not treated (n = 134) with mTOR. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Using standard laboratory methods we assessed iron status: serum iron, total iron binding capacity, ferritin, TSAT, complete blood count and creatinine. Soluble transferrin receptor (sTFR), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hSCRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) hepcidin, and cystatin C were measured using commercially available kits. RESULTS: According to the World Health Organization definition, the prevalence of anemia was 51% among mTOR treated whereas in the rest of the OHT the prevalence of anemia 30% among the other OHT patients. Functional iron deficiency was present in 80% of mTOR-treated patients. Serum hepcidin, IL-6, hsCRP, serum creatinine, cystatin C, NT-proBNP were significantly higher among mTOR treated patients; whereas sTFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate, hemoglobin, and erythrocyte count were significantly lower. CONCLUSIONS: Functional iron deficiency which is common among OHT patients treated with mTOR, was associated with high hepcidin levels and inflammatory markers.

The prevalence and potential effects of its chronic insufficiency on quality of life and physical function in patients undergoing THA have received little attention. QUESTION/PURPOSES: We determined (1) prevalence of preoperative vitamin D insufficiency in patients undergoing THA and (2) relationships of insufficiency to patient-perceived outcomes (PPOs) and hip scores. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 62 consecutive patients who underwent 66 primary THAs. We excluded two patients with missing data and the second hip of bilateral THAs, leaving 60 patients (60 hips) for final inclusion. Based on preoperative plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 levels, patients were retrospectively assigned into a normal or insufficient group. We used two different thresholds (20 and 30 ng/mL) to define insufficiency; groups were set twice. We compared demographics, BMI, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, Charlson Comorbidity Index; albumin, transferrin, calcium levels; and total lymphocyte count between groups. The insufficient group had a higher mean BMI with the 20-ng/mL cutoff but not with the 30-ng/mL cutoff. We compared the 20-ng/mL cutoff groups (adjusting for BMI) and the 30-ng/mL cutoff groups in terms of preoperative and postoperative Quality of Well-being Scale, SF-36, WOMAC, Harris hip, and Merle d'Aubign-Postel scores. Mean followup was 11 months (range, 3-24 months). RESULTS: The prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency was 30% (using 20 ng/mL) and 65% (using 30 ng/mL). Preoperative and postoperative Harris hip and Merle d'Aubign-Postel scores were lower in patients with insufficiency using 30 ng/mL. No differences in PPOs or hip scores were found using 20 ng/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Hypovitaminosis D was common in patients with THA and associated with lower hip scores. Standardization of the definition of hypovitaminosis D is urgently needed so that further studies can properly evaluate its real prevalence, potential negative effects on function, and therapeutic effects of reversing insufficiency before THA.","vitamin d insufficiency, 30", patients  tha: postel scores  lower  patients,"/ mL cutoff groups ( adjusting for BMI ) and the 30-ng / mL cutoff groups in terms of preoperative and postoperative Quality of Well-being Scale , SF-36 , WOMAC , Harris hip , and Merle d'Aubign-Postel scores .

METHODS: From a cohort of 130 patients with a BMI of 35-50 kg/m(2), 65 were randomly selected to undergo RYGBP and 65 to BPD-RYGBP. All underwent follow-up evaluation at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively and every year thereafter. RESULTS: Follow-up at the eighth year was achieved in 60% of the BPD-RYGBP and in 58% of the RYGBP group (p = 1.00). Mean excess weight loss (EWL%), was significantly higher following BPD-RYGBP (76.89  1.53) as compared to RYGBP (67.17  1.43) (p = 0.0004). The mean success rate (percentage of patients with EWL% =50%) was significantly higher after BPD-RYGBP (95.85  1.01) than RYGBP (75.91  3.58) (p = 0.0001). No significant differences were observed for late non-metabolic complications. The incidence of anemia, iron deficiency, B12 deficiency, and low-ferritin levels was relatively high in both groups with not always significant differences. Severe protein malnutrition occurred in four patients (three BPD-RYGBP and one RYGBP) (p = 0.37). In only one BPD-RYGBP patient (1.54%) was revision surgery to RYGBP necessary, due to recurrent episodes of hypoproteinemia.

203,24188615_1,24188615, Heme iron intake and risk of new-onset diabetes in a Mediterranean population at high risk of cardiovascular disease: an observational cohort analysis. ,"BACKGROUND: Several epidemiological studies have observed an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among subjects with a higher consumption of red and processed meat. Heme iron intake has been directly associated with a higher risk of T2DM in healthy adult Chinese and U.S populations. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the association between heme iron intake and the incidence of T2DM in a Mediterranean population at high cardiovascular risk. METHODS: We assessed a subset of participants in the PREDIMED trial as an observational cohort, followed up for a maximum of eight years. We initially included 1073 non-diabetic subjects (57.1% women) aged 67.3  6.0 years, at high cardiovascular risk. Diet was assessed at the study baseline using a validated, semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: During the follow-up period 131 diabetics were newly diagnosed. The risk of developing T2DM was assessed using baseline heme iron intake and proportional hazard models, first unadjusted, then adjusted for energy, and finally adjusted for dietary, anthropometric, socio-demographic and lifestyle variables. Significant direct associations with the incidence of T2DM were found for heme iron (Hazard Ratio [HR] 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 1.66). Secondarily, we have also observed that coffee (HR:0.93, 95% CI, 0.89 to 0.98) and alcoholic beverages (HR: 1.02, 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.04) were also found to reduce and increase the risk of T2DM, respectively.

204,24339903_1,24339903, Evidence for the high importance of co-morbid factors in HFE C282Y/H63D patients cared by phlebotomies: results from an observational prospective study. ,"Despite type I haemochromatosis (HC) is mainly associated with the HFE C282Y/C282Y genotype, a second genotype -C282Y/H63D- has mostly been described in other patients. Its association with HC, apart from any associated co-morbid factors, remains unclear and complex to interpret for physicians. This study assesses the weight of this genotype and the role of co-morbid factors in the occurrence of iron overload. This prospective study included the C282Y/C282Y (n = 172) and C282Y/H63D (n = 58) patients enrolled in a phlebotomy program between 2004 and 2007 in a blood centre of western Brittany (Brest, France), where HC is frequent. We compared prevalence of these two genotypes, as well as patients' profile regarding degree of iron overload and prevalence of co-morbid factors. First, we confirmed the obvious deficit of C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes among patients cared by phlebotomies. This genotype was 3.0 times less frequent than the C282Y/C282Y genotype among those patients (18.9% vs. 56.0%) whereas it was 4.9 times more frequent in the general population (4.3% vs. 0.9%; p<0.0001). Despite a similar level of hyperferritinaemia, the C282Y/H63D patients who came to medical attention had a milder plasma iron overload, reflected by a lower transferrin saturation median (52.0% vs. 84.0%; p<0.0001). They also exhibited more frequently co-morbid factors, as heavy drinking (26.0% vs. 13.9%; p = 0.0454), overweight (66.7% vs. 39.4%; p = 0.0005) or both (21.3% vs. 2.6%; p<0.0001). Ultimately, they required a lower amount of iron removed to reach depletion (2.1 vs. 3.4 g; p<0.0001), clearly reflecting their lower tissue iron. This study confirms that H63D is a discrete genetic susceptibility factor whose expression is most visible in association with other co-factors. It highlights the importance of searching for co-morbidities in these diagnostic situations and of providing lifestyle and dietary advice.","co morbid factors,  haemochromatosis,",hfe c282yh63d patients cared   well  patients,"two genotypes , as well as patients ' profile regarding degree of iron overload and prevalence of co-morbid factors .

USPIO-administration was recently shown to enable an improved characterization of myocardial infarct pathology in acute STEMI patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen study patients (IRON, 54  9 yrs, 88% male) and 22 matched controls (CONTROL, 57  9 yrs, 77% male) both with primary reperfused STEMI underwent multi-parametric CMR studies in the first week and three months after acute MI. Only IRON patients received a single intravenous bolus of 510 mg elemental iron as ferumoxytol (Feraheme(TM)) within four days following acute MI. RESULTS: Three months later, all patients were alive and there were no adverse cardiac events. Significant improvement in left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (IRON: 53  10% to 59  9%, p=0.002; CONTROL: 54  6% to 57  10%, p=0.005) as well as shrinkage of infarct size were seen in both groups at follow-up.

213,24896285_1,24896285, Iron supplementation among pregnant women: results from a population-based survey study. ,"OBJECTIVES: To measure the prevalence and risk factors associated with iron supplementation among pregnant women in the municipality of Rio Grande, Southern Brazil. METHODS: All mothers living in this municipality who had children in 2007 were surveyed for demographic, socioeconomic and health care received during pregnancy and childbirth. The statistical analysis consisted of Poisson regression with robust adjustment of variance, and the measure of effect was prevalence ratio (PR).

METHODS AND RESULTS: Iron parameters of patients hospitalized for decompensation of chronic heart failure were prospectively assessed during the 72 h after hospital admission. Iron deficiency was defined according to the 2012 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines. Overall, 411 men (75  12 years; 75% NYHA functional classes III/IV) and 421 women (81  11 years; 71% NYHA classes III/IV) were evaluated. The prevalence of iron deficiency was 69% in men and 75% in women (including 41% and 49% with absolute iron deficiency, respectively). The prevalence of anaemia in men (<13 g/dL) was 68% and in women (<12 g/dL) it was 52%. Among non-anaemic patients, the prevalence of iron deficiency was 57% in men and 79% in women.

","AIMS: Current heart failure (HF) guidelines highlight the importance of iron deficiency (ID) in HF. Whether HF itself or age-related comorbidities contribute to ID is uncertain, and previous data were limited to Western populations. We aimed to study the prevalence, clinical correlates, functional significance and prognosis of ID in HF patients, compared with community-based controls in a multi-ethnic Southeast Asian population. METHODS AND RESULTS: Iron status was assessed in 751 HF patients (age 62.0  12.2 years, 75.5% men, 64.7% Chinese, 23.9% Malay, 10.2% Indian) and 601 controls (age 56.9  10.4 years, 49.8% men, 70.9% Chinese, 21.5% Malay, 7.2% Indian). ID, defined as ferritin <100 g/L or ferritin 100-300 g/L and transferrin saturation (Tsat) <20%, was present in 39.3% of controls and 61.4% of HF [odds ratio (OR) 3.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.5-4.9, adjusting for clinical covariates]. Independent correlates of ID in HF were Indian ethnicity (OR 2.4 vs. Chinese, 95% CI 1.2-5.0), female gender (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.7-4.8), larger body mass index (OR 1.05/unit increase, 95% CI 1.01-1.1) and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (OR 1.03/unit decrease, 95% CI 1.01-1.04). In a subset of 48 HF patients undergoing cardiopulmonary exercise testing, Tsat correlated with peak oxygen consumption (<U+03C1> = 0.53, P < 0.01), independent of baseline characteristics. The HF patients with Tsat <20% as well as anaemia showed the poorest event-free survival after adjusting for clinical covariates. CONCLUSIONS: ID was highly prevalent and independently related to functional capacity and outcomes in our cohort.

Independent correlates of ID in HF were Indian ethnicity (OR 2.4 vs. Chinese, 95% CI 1.2-5.0), female gender (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.7-4.8), larger body mass index (OR 1.05/unit increase, 95% CI 1.01-1.1) and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (OR 1.03/unit decrease, 95% CI 1.01-1.04).

The biomarkers of iron status-serum iron concentration (SIC), total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and transferrin saturation (TSAT) together with standard clinical, biochemical and echocardiographic variables-were analyzed. In-hospital mortality was 3.8% (15 patients). The prevalences of anemia (according to WHO criteria), and iron deficiency (ID) were 64 and 63%, respectively. The level of biomarkers of iron status, but not anemia, was lower in patients who died (p < 0.05). Anemia was less frequent in patients with ACS as compared to the remaining ICCU population (p = 0.019). The analysis by logistic regression indicated the highest risk of death for age [odds ratio (OD) 1.38, 95% CI 1.27-1.55], SIC (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.78-0.94), TIBC (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91-0.98), left ventricle ejection fraction (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.77-0.93), as well as hospitalization for non-ACS (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.14-0.46), (p < 0.05). The risk of death during hospitalization tended to increase with decreasing levels of TIBC (p = 0.49), as well as with the absence of ACS (p = 0.54).

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the relationship between serum ferritin levels and the metabolic syndrome in Spanish adult males. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the Aragon Workers' Health Study. SETTING: Healthy workers from a factory were studied during their annual checkup. PARTICIPANTS: Spanish male adults (n = 3386) between the ages of 19 and 65 years participated. We excluded participants with ferritin > 500 g/L, ferritin < 12 g/L, or C-reactive protein > 10 mg/L. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the 2009 consensus definition from the Joint Interim Statement of several international societies. RESULTS: Metabolic syndrome prevalence was 27.1%. We found a positive association between elevated iron stores, measured as serum ferritin concentration, and metabolic syndrome and its criteria. Participants within the highest serum ferritin quintile had a higher risk than those in the lowest quintile for central obesity (odds ratio [OR], 1.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.46-2.42), hypertriglyceridemia (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.69-2.74), and metabolic syndrome (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.48-2.49). The association was nonlinear and occurred at serum ferritin concentrations > 100 g/L (~ 33th percentile). Ferritin was also associated with insulin resistance, measured by homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (P trend < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that serum ferritin is significantly associated with metabolic syndrome and its criteria (especially central obesity and hypertriglyceridemia), suggesting that ferritin could be an early marker of metabolic damage in the development of metabolic syndrome.","ferritin elevation, metabolic syndrome",elevation  metabolic syndro ,"years participated .

Prevalence of MeS was 50.3%; hypertension, 83.7%; diabetes mellitus, 52%; high triglyceride level, 34%, low HDL cholesterol, 48.3%; and abdominal obesity, 41.3%. During the study, the CHD was more frequent in patients with MeS (27.8%) than was in those without MeS (14.1%) (P = 0.004). In addition, stroke happened more frequently in the MeS group than in those without MeS (30.5% vs. 17.4%; P = 0.008). The mean number of criteria for MeS was not significantly associated with mortality causes (CHD, 2.7  1.3; stroke, 2.8  0.9; other causes, 2.9  1.3 P = 0.78). However, hypertension (89.3%) and diabetes mellitus (53.8%) were associated with increased risk for mortality. In the group of MeS, CHD were not significantly associated with serum albumin, calcium, phosphate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, ferritin, C-reactive protein, and KT/V; but there was significant association with white blood cells count (P < 0.0002).

","The evolution of metabolic and cardiovascular disease (CVD) complications after liver transplantation (LT) is poorly characterized. We aim to illustrate the prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome (MS), define the cumulative incidence of CVD, and characterize risk factors associated with these comorbidities after LT. A retrospective review of 455 consecutive LT recipients from 1999 to 2004 with an 8- to 12-year follow-up was performed. Obesity increased from 23.8% (4 months) to 40.8% (3 years) after LT. Increase in body mass index predicted MS at 1 year after LT (odds ratio, 1.1; P < 0.001, per point). CVD developed in 10.6%, 20.7%, and 30.3% of recipients within 1, 5, and 8 years, respectively. Age, diabetes, hypertension, glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/minute, prior CVD, ejection fraction < 60%, left ventricular hypertrophy, and serum troponin (TN) > 0.07 ng/mL were associated with CVD on univariate analysis. Age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.06; P = 0.019), diabetes (HR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.09-2.92; P = 0.022), prior history of CVD (HR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.45-4.16; P < 0.001), and serum TN > 0.07 ng/mL (HR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.23-3.18; P = 0.005) were independently associated with CVD in the long term. Smoking history (ever), sex, hyperlipidemia, and serum ferritin levels were not predictive of CVD. Tacrolimus use versus noncalcineurin-based immunosuppression (HR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.14-0.49; P < 0.001) was associated with reduced risk of CVD but not versus cyclosporine (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.30-1.49; P = 0.322).

Consequently, hepcidin may be a key determinant of the iron homeostasis and anemia associated with poorer HIV prognoses. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to understand how hepcidin is related to anemia, iron homeostasis, and inflammation at HIV diagnosis and to investigate associations between hepcidin and all-cause mortality in HIV infection. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort, baseline plasma hepcidin was measured by competitive enzyme immunoassay within 3 mo of HIV diagnosis in 196 antiretroviral-naive Gambians. Iron homeostasis [hemoglobin, plasma transferrin, ferritin, iron, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR)] and inflammation [a1-antichymotrypsin (ACT)] from the same plasma sample were available, as were absolute CD4 cell counts, age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and HIV type. RESULTS: Anemia was common across the spectrum of immunosuppression [CD4 cell counts (prevalence of anemia): >500 cells/L (68%), 200-500 cells/L (73%), and <200 cells/L (89%); P = 0.032] and in men (81%) and women (76%). Increasing hepcidin was associated with iron homeostasis biomarkers (higher ferritin and lower transferrin, hemoglobin, and sTfR), inflammation (higher ACT), and key health indicators (lower CD4 or BMI, advancing age, and male gender; P < 0.001 except for hemoglobin, P = 0.021). Elevated hepcidin was associated with greater all-cause mortality in a dose-dependent manner [intermediate vs. lowest tertile: unadjusted HR (95% CI), 1.95 (1.22, 3.10); upper vs. lowest tertile: 3.02 (1.91, 4.78)]. Principal components analysis identified 2 patterns composed of hepcidin-ferritin-transferrin, with or without ACT, and iron-sTfR-hemoglobin that may distinguish inflammation and erythropoiesis iron functions.

METHODS: Adult patients with newly diagnosed AML who were initially treated with conventional 3 + 7 induction chemotherapy within 5 days of their diagnosis were included. Patients with previous cytotoxic chemotherapy <3 years, acute promyelocytic leukemia diagnosis, human immunodeficiency virus infection, or significant systemic infection at the time of diagnosis were excluded. Patients were treated with an institutional policy of substantial identity with negligible differences regarding supportive care. RESULTS: Among 110 patients (median age 54.5 years), 39 infectious events in 38 patients were reported, along with 21 episodes of infectious treatment-related mortality (TRM; 19.1%). Elevated pre-treatment CRP (p = 0.032) and ferritin (p = 0.002) were related to the incidence of systemic infection. The degree of increase of blood CRP and ferritin level was correlated with the extent of leukocytosis. However, patients with elevated inflammatory markers above normal range had increased risk of infection irrespective of whether they had leukocytosis or not, suggesting that expansion of leukemic blast is another factor affecting the elevation of the markers independent to infection propensity and therefore the magnitude of the elevation does not quantitatively predict the risk of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Modest elevation of baseline blood inflammatory markers above the normal range could be an indicator for predicting the incidence of systemic infection in patients with AML.","systemic infection, c reactive protein,acute myeloid leukemia,", patients  acute myeloid leukemia. among 110 patients,"differences regarding supportive care .

The relationship between different cardiovascular biomarkers and ID is unknown, and the true prevalence of ID in an outpatient HF clinic is probably overlooked. OBJECTIVES: To identify the prevalence of ID in a HF clinic and evaluate whether ID is associated with increased plasma concentrations of different cardiovascular biomarkers that carry a poor prognosis. METHODS: We prospectively included 149 patients with systolic HF referred to an outpatients HF clinic. ID was defined as ferritin<100 g/L or ferritin 100-300 g/L and Tranferin-saturation<0.20. Five different cardiovascular biomarkers were analyzed on frozen plasma. RESULTS: The patients had a median age of 70 (Interquartile range: 64-75) years, 25% were females, 29% were in functional class III-IV and LVEF was 32 (27-39) %.

280,26683908_1,26683908, Vitamin D Status and the Risk of Anemia in Community-Dwelling Adults: Results from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001-2006. ,"Low vitamin D status has been implicated in several chronic medical conditions and unfavorable health outcomes. Our goal was to investigate whether serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels are a potentially modifiable risk factor for anemia in a nationally representative cohort of community-dwelling individuals in the United States. We performed a cross-sectional study of 5456 individuals (=17 years) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2001 to 2006. Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) was used to graphically depict the relationship between serum 25OHD levels and the cumulative frequency of anemia. Multivariable logistic regression models were then used to assess the independent association of 25OHD levels with anemia, while controlling for age, sex, race, body mass index, chronic kidney disease, as well as serum levels of C-reactive protein, ferritin, iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid. The mean (standard error) 25OHD and hemoglobin levels in the analytic group were 23.5 (0.4) ng/mL and 14.4 (0.1) g/dL, respectively. Prevalence of anemia was 3.9%. Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing analysis demonstrated a near-linear relationship between vitamin D status and cumulative frequency of anemia up to 25OHD levels of approximately 20 ng/mL. With increasing 25OHD levels, the curve flattened out progressively. Multivariable regression analysis demonstrated an inverse association of 25OHD levels with the risk of anemia (adjusted odds ratio 0.97; 95% confidence interval 0.95-0.99 per 1 ng/mL change in 25OHD). Compared to individuals with =20 ng/mL, individuals with 25OHD levels <20 ng/mL were more likely to be anemic (adjusted odds ratio 1.64; 95% confidence interval 1.08-2.49). In a nationally representative sample of community-dwelling individuals in the United States, low 25OHD levels were associated with increased risk of anemia. Randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether optimizing vitamin D status can reduce the burden of anemia in the general population.","anemia,  locally weighted scatterplot smoothing,",d status   risk  anemi ,"kidney disease , as well as serum levels of C-reactive protein , ferritin , iron , vitamin B12 , and folic acid .

282,26915864_1,26915864, Absolute and Functional Iron Deficiency Is a Common Finding in Patients With Heart Failure and After Heart Transplantation. ,"BACKGROUND: Anemia is relatively common in patients with heart failure and heart transplant recipients. Both absolute and functional iron deficiency may contribute to the anemia in these populations. Functional iron deficiency (defined as ferritin greater than 200 ng/mL with TSAT (Transferrin saturation) less than 20%) is characterized by the presence of adequate iron stores as defined by conventional criteria, but with insufficient iron mobilization to adequately support. The aim of this study was to determine prevalence of absolute and functional iron deficiency in patients with heart failure (n = 269) and after heart transplantation (n = 130) and their relation to parameters of iron status and inflammation. METHODS: Iron status, complete blood count, and creatinine levels were assessed using standard laboratory methods. C-reactive protein, hepcidin and hemojuvelin were measured using commercially available kits. RESULTS: Absolute iron deficiency was present in 15% of patients with heart failure and 30% in heart transplant recipients, whereas functional iron deficiency was present in 18% of patients with heart failure and 17% in heart transplant recipients. Functional iron deficiency was associated with significantly higher C-reactive protein and hepcidin levels in heart failure patients, and higher hepcidin and lower estimate glomerular filtration rates in heart transplant recipients. Prevalence of anemia (according to the World Health Organization) was significantly higher in heart transplant recipients (40% vs 22%, P < .001), they were also younger, but with worse kidney function than patients with heart failure.

Iron metabolism is rather complex and there is some new information concerning this complexity in heart failure. We distinquish an absolute and a functional iron deficiency in heart failure. It is this deficit which is important and not as much is anemia important here. Prevalence of anaemia in heart failure is about 30-50%, higher it is in patients suffering more frequently heart failure decompensations. Treatment of iron deficiency is important and it improves prognosis of these patients.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiology of anemia and iron deficiency in a broad range of patients referred to a cardiology clinic with suspected HF. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We collected clinical data, including hemoglobin, serum iron, transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin concentrations, on consecutive patients referred with suspected HF to a single outpatient clinic serving a local community from January 1, 2001, through December 31, 2010. Follow-up data were censored on December 13, 2011. Patients underwent phenotyping by echocardiography and plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide measurement and were followed for up to 10 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalences of anemia and iron deficiency and their interrelationship, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular mortality. RESULTS: Of 4456 patients enrolled in the study, the median (interquartile range) age was 73 (65-79) years, 2696 (60.5%) were men, and 1791 (40.2%) had left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD). Of those without LVSD, plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide concentration was greater than 400 pg/mL in 1172 (26.3%), less than 400 pg/mL in 841 (18.9%), and not measured in 652 (14.6%). Overall, 1237 patients (27.8%) had anemia, with a higher prevalence (987 [33.3%]) in patients who met the criteria for HF with or without LVSD.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiology of anemia and iron deficiency in a broad range of patients referred to a cardiology clinic with suspected HF. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We collected clinical data, including hemoglobin, serum iron, transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin concentrations, on consecutive patients referred with suspected HF to a single outpatient clinic serving a local community from January 1, 2001, through December 31, 2010. Follow-up data were censored on December 13, 2011. Patients underwent phenotyping by echocardiography and plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide measurement and were followed for up to 10 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalences of anemia and iron deficiency and their interrelationship, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular mortality. RESULTS: Of 4456 patients enrolled in the study, the median (interquartile range) age was 73 (65-79) years, 2696 (60.5%) were men, and 1791 (40.2%) had left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD).

METHODS: This is a single-center observational study, conducted at a tertiary care hospital of south Rajasthan. Patients admitted to hospital with clinical diagnosis of HF based on validated clinical criteria were included in the study. ID was diagnosed based on complete Iron profile, including serum iron, serum ferritin, total iron binding capacity, and transferrin saturation (TSAT). Anemia was defined as hemoglobin (Hb) <13g/dl for males and <12g/dl for females, based on World Health Organization definition. Absolute ID was taken as serum ferritin<100g/L and functional ID was defined as normal serum ferritin (100-300g/L) with low TSAT (<20%). RESULTS: A total of 150 patients of HF (68% males and 32% females) were studied. Most of the patients were of high-functional NYHA class (mean NYHA 2.890.95). ID was present in 76% patients with 48.7% patients having absolute and 27.3% patients having functional ID.

Patients admitted to hospital with clinical diagnosis of HF based on validated clinical criteria were included in the study. ID was diagnosed based on complete Iron profile, including serum iron, serum ferritin, total iron binding capacity, and transferrin saturation (TSAT). Anemia was defined as hemoglobin (Hb) <13g/dl for males and <12g/dl for females, based on World Health Organization definition. Absolute ID was taken as serum ferritin<100g/L and functional ID was defined as normal serum ferritin (100-300g/L) with low TSAT (<20%).

During a median follow-up of 8.3 (interquartile range 7.8-8.9) years, 199 subjects (3.1%) were newly diagnosed with HF, 456 (7.1%) experienced a CV event, and 356 (5.6%) died from all causes. A higher annual HF incidence per ferritin quartile was observed in women (P < 0.001), but not in men (P for interaction 0.032). Multivariable analyses demonstrated ferritin levels to remain independently predictive for new-onset HF in women only (P = 0.024).

314,27778088_1,27778088," Association between full breastfeeding, timing of complementary food introduction, and iron status in infancy in Germany: results of a secondary analysis of a randomized trial. ","PURPOSE: Considering the low content in breast milk breastfed infants might be at particular risk for depleted iron stores after the first months of life. This study evaluates the association of the mode of milk feeding and the timing of complementary food (CF) introduction with parameters of iron status in term healthy infants in Germany. METHODS: In this secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial, parents recorded all foods consumed by their infants from the age of 8 weeks onwards. Mothers were advised on the German food-based dietary guidelines for infants. Accordingly, CF was introduced between the fifth and seventh month of age. Blood samples were taken at 4 and at 10 months of age for analyses of iron status parameters. Iron depletion was defined as serum ferritin <12 ng/mL. RESULTS: The iron intake was lower in breastfed infants (n = 50) than in formula fed (n = 23) with decreasing differences during the course of infancy. At 10 months of age, most iron parameters were not associated with the mode of milk feeding or the timing of CF introduction. At this age, the iron depletion prevalence was >34% without general differences according to the mode of milk feeding or the timing of CF introduction. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of depleted iron stores observed in both breastfed and formula-fed infants illustrates the need for further studies to improve our understanding of the optimal iron intake and sensitive parameters of iron status in infancy.","depleted iron stores observed,  complementary food,",infancy  germany ,"breastfed infants ( n = 50 ) than in formula fed ( n = 23 ) with decreasing differences during the course of infancy .

This study investigated the relationship between ferritin, a marker of iron status, and the incidence of HF in a community-based cohort. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined 1063 participants who were free of heart failure from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study in whom ferritin serum levels were measured at baseline (1987-1989). The participants (mean age 52.7  5.5 years, 62% women), were categorized in low (<30 ng/mL; n = 153), normal (30-200 ng/mL in women and 30-300 ng/mL in men; n = 663), and high (>200 ng/mL in women and >300 ng/mL in men; n = 247) ferritin levels. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the relationship between ferritin and incident HF. After 21  4.6 years of follow-up, HF occurred in 144 (13.5%) participants. When compared with participants with normal ferritin levels, participants with low ferritin levels had a higher risk of HF [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15-4.35; P = 0.02] as did those with high ferritin levels (HR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.01-3.25; P = 0.04), after adjusting for potential confounders. Notably, low ferritin levels remained associated with incident HF even after excluding subjects with anaemia (HR = 2.28, 95% CI 1.11-4.68; P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Derangements in iron metabolism, either low or high ferritin serum levels, were associated with higher risk of incident HF in a general population, even without concurrent anaemia. These findings suggest that iron imbalance might play a role in the development of HF.","heart failure,  community based, heart failure,atherosclerosis risk, communities,hazard ratio,confidence interval",levels  risk  heart failu ,"iron status , and the incidence of HF in a community-based cohort .

316,28229219_1,28229219, Prevalence and clinical impact of iron deficiency and anaemia among outpatients with chronic heart failure: The PrEP Registry. ,"BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency (ID) and anaemia are common in heart failure (HF). The prospective, observational PReP registry (Prvalenz des Eisenmangels bei Patienten mit Herzinsuffizienz) studied prevalence and clinical impact of ID and anaemia in HF outpatients attending cardiology practices in Germany. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 42 practices enrolled consecutive patients with chronic HF [left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) =45%]. ID was defined as serum ferritin <100 g/l, or serum ferritin =100 g/l/<300 g/l plus transferrin saturation <20%, and anaemia as haemoglobin <13 g/dl (12 g/dl) in men (women). Exercise capacity was assessed using spiroergometry (69.4%) or 6-min walk test (30.4%). Amongst 1198 PReP-participants [69.0  10.6 years, 25.3% female, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 2.4  0.5, LVEF 35.3  7.2%], ID was found in 42.5% (previously unknown in all), and anaemia in 18.9% (previously known in 4.8%). ID was associated with female gender, lower body weight and haemoglobin, higher NYHA class and natriuretic peptide (NP) levels (all p < 0.05). ID was also more common in anaemic than non-anaemic patients (p < 0.0001), and 9.8% of PrEP-participants had both, ID and anaemia. On spiroergometry, ID independently predicted maximum exercise capacity even after multivariable adjustment, including anaemia (p = 0.0004). In all PrEP-participants, ID predicted reduced physical performance (adjusted for age, gender, anaemia, serum creatinine, C-reactive protein, LVEF, and NP level). CONCLUSIONS: Despite high prevalence, ID was previously unknown in all PrEP-participants, and anaemia was often unappreciated. Given the clinical relevance, treatability, and independent association with reduced physical performance, ID should be considered more in real-world ambulatory healthcare settings and ID-screening be advocated to cardiologists in such populations.","iron deficiency, anaemia, iron deficiency,heart failure,left ventricular ejection fraction,new york heart association",  42 practices enrolled consecutive patients,"HF ) .

The aim of this study is to estimate the prevalence of overweight, obesity, and hepatic late adverse effects in a cohort of ALL survivors treated at the Hematology and Oncology Unit, Pediatrics Department, Menoufia University, Egypt. METHODS: In this case-control study, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) were assessed for 35 pediatric ALL survivors and 35 healthy children. These parameters were plotted on the growth and WHO standard deviation charts for both males and females. Overweight and obesity were defined by BMI > 85(th) and 95(th) percentile respectively. Laboratory investigations were done in the form of iron profile, liver enzymes, total and direct bilirubin levels, serum urea &creatinine and detection of hepatitis C virus antibodies by ELISA. RESULTS: The weight and BMI were significantly greater in the survivors than controls (P value =0.002 and 0.039 respectively). ALT, total & direct bilirubin, serum ferritin and transferrin saturation were considerably higher in the survivors than the controls (P value = 0.03, 0.036, 0.044, 0.006 and 0.03 respectively). Ten (28.6%) of survivors had hepatitis C antibodies with none (0%) of controls (P value =0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric ALL survivors are at increased risk of overweight/obesity, hepatic dysfunction in the form of elevated liver enzymes, bilirubin levels, and C viral hepatitis.

The infants were randomly assigned to receive a placebo or 1 or 2 mg Fe . kg(-1) . d(-1) from 6 wk to 6 mo of age. In secondary analyses at the age of 7 y, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and the prevalence of children with BP within the hypertensive range (>90th percentile) were compared between the groups.Results: BP was analyzed via intention to treat in 189 children (66%). The mean  SD SBP was 103  8.1, 101  7.5, and 101  7.8 mm Hg in children who had received the placebo (n = 70), 1 mg Fe . kg(-1) . d(-1) (n = 54), or 2 mg Fe . kg(-1) . d(-1) (n = 65), respectively. When the iron-supplemented groups were combined in covariate-adjusted analyses, the mean SBP in LBW children who had received iron supplementation in infancy was 2.2 mm Hg (95% CI: 0.3, 4.2 mm Hg) lower than in those who were unsupplemented (P = 0.026). Multivariate logistic regression showed that iron supplementation in infancy reduced the odds of having an SBP within the hypertensive range at 7 y of age (OR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.96). For DBP, there were no significant differences between the intervention groups.Conclusions: LBW children who receive iron supplementation (1 or 2 mg Fe . kg(-1) . d(-1)) in infancy have lower SBP at 7 y. This (to our knowledge) novel observation suggests that the increased risk of hypertension that is observed in children and adults who are born small might be reduced with early micronutrient interventions.

","Incidence, epidemiology, and risk factors of invasive fungal diseases (IFDs) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) recipients can vary from different cohorts and countries. Therefore, we performed a nationwide study to establish a proper antifungal prophylaxis strategies based on risk stratifications of IFDs after all-HSCT in Korea (RISK study). This was a multicenter, retrospective, and observational study in Korea. All consecutive adult patients who received allo-HSCT in 2013 were included. The 12-month cumulative incidence of proven/probable IFDs (PP-IFDs) was calculated during the early (days 0 to 40), late (days 41 to 100), and very late (days 101 to 365) phases after allo-HSCT. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for PP-IFDs at each phase. A total 521 allo-HSCT cases in 518 patients were analyzed. Overall cumulative incidence of PP-IFDs were 4.09% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.38 to 5.81), 7.38% (95% CI, 5.09 to 9.67), and 15.36% (95% CI, 12.04 to 18.68) at the early, late and very phases, respectively. In multiple Cox regression analysis, variables were associated with PP-IFDs in each period were identified. Variables associated with early phase include underlying pulmonary diseases, underlying nonmalignant stable or chronic disease at allo-HSCT, unrelated or family mismatched donor, and prolonged neutropenia. Variables associated with the late phase include high ferritin level at the time point of allo-HSCT, use of secondary immunosuppressive agents due to refractory graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and cytomegalovirus reactivation. For the very late phase, variables were secondary neutropenia, severe chronic GVHD, and use of TNF-alpha inhibitor for refractory GVHD. This study revealed the high cumulative incidence of IFDs in Korean allo-HSCT recipients, which have distinct risk factors in each phase after allo-HSCT. Our findings indicate that tailored antifungal prophylaxis is necessary for high-risk patients. Clinicians should consider using mold-active antifungal prophylaxis in allo-HSCT recipients who have high risks at different treatment period.","pp ifds,  graft versus host disease,","korea: results  ""risk"" study allo hsct cases  518 patients","0 to 40 ) , late ( days 41 to 100 ) , and very late ( days 101 to 365 ) phases after allo-HSCT .

Therefore, we performed a nationwide study to establish a proper antifungal prophylaxis strategies based on risk stratifications of IFDs after all-HSCT in Korea (RISK study). This was a multicenter, retrospective, and observational study in Korea. All consecutive adult patients who received allo-HSCT in 2013 were included. The 12-month cumulative incidence of proven/probable IFDs (PP-IFDs) was calculated during the early (days 0 to 40), late (days 41 to 100), and very late (days 101 to 365) phases after allo-HSCT. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for PP-IFDs at each phase. A total 521 allo-HSCT cases in 518 patients were analyzed. Overall cumulative incidence of PP-IFDs were 4.09% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.38 to 5.81), 7.38% (95% CI, 5.09 to 9.67), and 15.36% (95% CI, 12.04 to 18.68) at the early, late and very phases, respectively. In multiple Cox regression analysis, variables were associated with PP-IFDs in each period were identified. Variables associated with early phase include underlying pulmonary diseases, underlying nonmalignant stable or chronic disease at allo-HSCT, unrelated or family mismatched donor, and prolonged neutropenia. Variables associated with the late phase include high ferritin level at the time point of allo-HSCT, use of secondary immunosuppressive agents due to refractory graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and cytomegalovirus reactivation. For the very late phase, variables were secondary neutropenia, severe chronic GVHD, and use of TNF-alpha inhibitor for refractory GVHD. This study revealed the high cumulative incidence of IFDs in Korean allo-HSCT recipients, which have distinct risk factors in each phase after allo-HSCT. Our findings indicate that tailored antifungal prophylaxis is necessary for high-risk patients. Clinicians should consider using mold-active antifungal prophylaxis in allo-HSCT recipients who have high risks at different treatment period.","pp ifds,  graft versus host disease,","korea: results  ""risk"" study allo hsct cases  518 patients","( days 101 to 365 ) phases after allo-HSCT .

330,28730869_1,28730869," Impact of iron deficiency on exercise capacity and outcome in heart failure with reduced, mid-range and preserved ejection fraction. ","BACKGROUND: Little information is available about the prevalence and impact on exercise capacity and outcome of iron deficiency in heart failure with mid-range (HFmrEF) and preserved (HFpEF) ejection fraction in comparison to heart failure with reduced ejection-fraction (HFrEF). Furthermore, no data is available about the progression of ID in patients without baseline anaemia. METHODS: We evaluated baseline iron and haemoglobin-status in a single-centre, prospective heart failure database. Baseline functional status, VO(2max), echocardiography and clinical-outcome (all-cause mortality and heart failure admissions) were evaluated. ID, anaemia, HFrEF, HFmrEF and HFpEF were defined according to established criteria. RESULTS: A total of 1197 patients (71% male) were evaluated (HFrEF, n = 897; HFmrEF, n = 229; HFpEF, n = 72). The overall prevalence of ID was 53% (50% in HFrEF; 61% in HFmrEF; 64% in HFpEF) and 36% for anaemia. ID was associated with a lower VO(2max) in patients with HFrEF, HFmrEF and HFpEF (p < .001 in all). Iron status more closely related to a poor VO(2max) than anaemia status (p < .001). Furthermore, poor clinical-outcome was more strongly associated with iron status than anaemia status. Exposing eight patients without anaemia to iron deficiency for 39 months resulted in one patient developing new-onset anaemia (defined as progression of ID). Patients with progression of ID exhibited a significant higher risk of heart failure hospitalisation and all-cause mortality (HR = 1.4; CI = 1.01-1.94; p = .046) than patients without progression.

ID was associated with a lower VO(2max) in patients with HFrEF, HFmrEF and HFpEF (p < .001 in all). Iron status more closely related to a poor VO(2max) than anaemia status (p < .001). Furthermore, poor clinical-outcome was more strongly associated with iron status than anaemia status. Exposing eight patients without anaemia to iron deficiency for 39 months resulted in one patient developing new-onset anaemia (defined as progression of ID). Patients with progression of ID exhibited a significant higher risk of heart failure hospitalisation and all-cause mortality (HR = 1.4; CI = 1.01-1.94; p = .046) than patients without progression. CONCLUSIONS: Iron deficiency is common in patients with HFrEF, HFmrEF and HFpEF, and negatively affects VO(2max) and clinical-outcome. Progression of iron deficiency parallels an increased risk for worsening of heart failure.","iron deficiency,  id, 53",heart failure  reduced mid range  preserved   total  1197 patients,".

METHODS AND RESULTS: Bone marrow aspiration with iron staining was performed in 42 patients with HF and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (=45%) undergoing median sternotomy for coronary artery bypass grafting. Patients were mostly male (76%) with mild-to-moderate HF and a mean age of 6810 years. Bone marrow ID was found in 17 (40%) of the HF patients.

343,29498039_1,29498039, Retrospective cohort study comparing the adverse reactions and efficacy of intravenous iron polymaltose with ferric carboxymaltose for iron deficiency anemia. ,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and the efficacy of intravenous iron polymaltose and ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) among gynecology/obstetric patients with anemia. METHODS: The present retrospective observational study examined data from anemic obstetrics and gynecology patients who received either iron polymaltose or FCM between January 1, 2011, and April 30, 2015, at The Royal Women's Hospital, Victoria, Australia. Patient demographic data, dosage, ADR documentation, and hemoglobin levels were collected from medical records and compared. RESULTS: The study included 221 patients; 111 and 110 received iron polymaltose and FCM, respectively. ADRs were documented for 18 (16.2%) patients in the iron polymaltose group and 2 (1.8%) in the FCM group (P<0.001), with no incidences of anaphylaxis. Both formulations achieved increased hemoglobin levels within 12 weeks (P<0.001 for both). Mean hemoglobin level increases were similar in both groups among non-pregnant patients (P=0.186), but were greater in the iron polymaltose cohort among pregnant patients (P=0.005). FCM dose compliance was suboptimal, with 8 of 57 (14%) patients who required second visits for doses greater than 1000 mg returning for the infusion. CONCLUSION: FCM was associated with a lower incidence of ADRs than iron polymaltose. Patients receiving FCM infusions were less likely to receive their total required iron dose.

We aimed to investigate the predictive value of both stored (MRI-derived liver iron content) and biologically active iron (enhanced labile plasma iron; eLPI) on post-transplantation outcomes in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome undergoing allogenic HCT. METHODS: The prospective, multicentre, observational, ALLogeneic Iron inVEstigators (ALLIVE) trial recruited patients at five centres in Germany. We enrolled patients with acute myeloid leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome undergoing allogeneic HCT. Patients underwent cytotoxic conditioning for a median of 6 days (IQR 6-7) before undergoing allogeneic HCT and were followed up for up to 1 year (3 months) post-transplantation. eLPI was measured in serum samples with the FeROS eLPI kit (Aferrix, Tel-Aviv, Israel) and values greater than 0.4 mol/L were considered to represent raised eLPI. Liver iron content was measured by MRI. The primary endpoints were the quantitative delineation of eLPI dynamics during allogeneic HCT and the correlation coefficient between liver iron content before HCT and dynamic eLPI (eLPI(dyn); maximum eLPI minus baseline eLPI). All patients with available data were included in all analyses. This is the final analysis of this completed trial, which is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01746147. FINDINGS: Between Dec 13, 2012, and Dec 23, 2014, 112 patients underwent allogeneic HCT. Liver iron content before allogeneic HCT was not significantly correlated with eLPI(dyn) (<U+03C1>=0.116, p=0.22). Serum eLPI concentrations rapidly increased during conditioning, and most (79 [73%] of 108) patients had raised eLPI by the day of transplantation. Patients with a pretransplant liver iron content greater than or equal to 125 mol/g had an increased incidence of non-relapse mortality (20%, 95% CI 14-26) compared with those with lower concentrations (7%, 2-12; p=0.039) at day 100. Patients who had raised eLPI at baseline also had a significantly increased incidence of non-relapse mortality at day 100 (33%, 15-52) compared with those who had normal eLPI at baseline (7%, 2-13; p=0.00034).

350,29663858_1,29663858, Assessment of liver and cardiac iron overload using MRI in patients with chronic anemias in Latin American countries: results from ASIMILA study. ,"OBJECTIVES: A multicenter, noninterventional, observational study was conducted in the Latin American countries including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela to assess the prevalence of liver and cardiac iron overload using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with chronic anemias except thalassemia. METHODS: Patients aged >10 years with transfusion-dependent anemias, except thalassemia, either with <20 units of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions with serum ferritin (SF) levels >2000 ng/mL or with =20 units of RBC transfusions regardless of SF level in their lifetime, were enrolled. Iron overload was assessed using MRI. RESULTS: Among 175 patients included, the majority had sickle cell disease (SCD; 52%), followed by aplastic anemia (AA; 17.7%), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; 8.6%), Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA; 4%), pure red cell aplasia (1.1%), and others (16.6%). Liver iron overload was observed in 76.4% of patients, while cardiac iron overload was seen in 19.2% when assessed by MRI. The prevalence of iron overload was 80.2% in patients with SCD, 73.3% in MDS, 77.4% in AA, 100% in pure red cell aplasia, 71.4% in DBA, and 68.9% in other transfusion-related disorders. A moderate correlation between liver iron concentration (LIC) and SF was observed in patients with SCD and MDS (r = 0.47 and r = 0.61, respectively). All adverse events reported were consistent with the published data for deferasirox or underlying disease. CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of iron overload in this patient population in Latin American countries indicates that a better diagnosis and management of iron overload is required in these countries.","iron overload,  magnetic resonance imaging,red blood cell,serum ferritin,liver iron concentration", patients  chronic anemias  latin american countries:  patients,"myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ; 8.6 % ) , Diamond-Blackfan anemia ( DBA ; 4 % ) , pure red cell aplasia ( 1.1 % ) , and others ( 16.6 % ) .

","BACKGROUND: Anemia is now considered as an important contributing factor to the deterioration of chronic heart failure. The present study aimed to assess the effects of intravenous iron therapy on clinical condition, left ventricular function and also quality of life in patients who suffered of chronic heart failure and concomitant iron deficiency. METHODS: In this clinical trial, 25 consecutive patients with concomitant chronic heart failure and iron deficiency referred to Shariati hospital in Isfahan, Iran in 2013. After initial clinical, laboratory, and echocardiography assessments, the patients administered 200 mg intravenous Iron per week until compensating iron deficit. Then, all study parameters were assessed again and compared to parameters before the therapeutic intervention. RESULTS: The NYHA class showed a significant improvement after the therapeutic approach. The prevalence of heart failure-related edema was also significantly reduced from 60% before treatment to 48% after that (p = 0.036). The rate of hospitalization was considerably reduced from 42% to 16% (P < 0.001). Moreover, mean 6 minute walk test (6MWT) was increased from 155.18 m to 187.40 m (P < 0.001).

Progressive inflammation and reduced iron transport associated with CKD and HF may reduce the efficacy of oral iron therapy. Oral ferric citrate improves anemia markers in CKD, but its effects in patients with CKD and concomitant HF have not been described. Patients with CKD not on dialysis and IDA from a phase 2 and 3 trial were treated with ferric citrate (n = 190) or placebo (n = 188); patients with HF were identified from medical histories. Hemoglobin response was defined as a =10.0-g/L increase in hemoglobin. Changes in hemoglobin, transferrin saturation, ferritin, and serum phosphate from baseline to week 12 and the incidence of adverse events potentially related to HF were evaluated.

","BACKGROUND: The prevalence of iron deficiency (ID) in outpatients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and its relation to exercise capacity and quality of life (QoL) is unknown. METHODS: 190 symptomatic outpatients with HFpEF (LVEF 58  7%; age 71  9 years; NYHA 2.4  0.5; BMI 31  6 kg/m(2)) were enrolled as part of SICA-HF in Germany, England and Slovenia. ID was defined as ferritin < 100 or 100-299 g/L with transferrin saturation (TSAT) < 20%. Anemia was defined as Hb < 13 g/dL in men, < 12 g/dL in women. Low ferritin-ID was defined as ferritin < 100 g/L. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to E/e' at echocardiography: E/e' = 8; E/e' 9-14; E/e' = 15. All patients underwent echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX), 6-min walk test (6-MWT), and QoL assessment using the EQ5D questionnaire. RESULTS: Overall, 111 patients (58.4%) showed ID with 89 having low ferritin-ID (46.84%). 78 (41.1%) patients had isolated ID without anemia and 54 patients showed anemia (28.4%). ID was more prevalent in patients with more severe diastolic dysfunction: E/e' = 8: 44.8% vs. E/e': 9-14: 53.2% vs. E/e' = 15: 86.5% (p = 0.0004). Patients with ID performed worse during the 6MWT (420  137 vs. 344  124 m; p = 0.008) and had worse exercise time in CPX (645  168 vs. 538  178 s, p = 0.03). Patients with low ferritin-ID had lower QoL compared to those without ID (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: ID is a frequent co-morbidity in HFpEF and is associated with reduced exercise capacity and QoL. Its prevalence increases with increasing severity of diastolic dysfunction.","iron deficiency, iron deficiency,l, transferrin saturation,cardiopulmonary exercise test,", patients  heart failure  preserved ejection fraction    patients  heart failure  preserved ejection ,BACKGROUND : The prevalence of iron deficiency ( ID ) in outpatients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction ( HFpEF ) and its relation to exercise capacity and quality of life ( QoL ) is unknown .

However, Indian data especially in the pediatric age group is scarce. This study was conducted to find out the prevalence of IDA in this population. METHODS: An observational study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital. Children with CCHD in the age group of birth-12 years were included in the study. Hematological parameters of these patients were determined and compared. An assessment of the incidence of cyanotic spells in the iron-deficient and iron non-deficient children was also done. Data analysis was done using Fischer's exact test. RESULTS: The prevalence of IDA was 47.06% in the study population. The study also showed that hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were paradoxically higher in the iron-deficient group as compared to the non-deficient, though the iron studies revealed the iron deficiency. The incidence of cyanotic spells was higher in the iron-deficient group. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV), red cell distribution width (RDW), serum ferritin, serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and transferrin saturation (TS) values were the parameters, which were found to be statistically significant to differentiate the study groups. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of IDA in children with CCHD was found to be high.

Our objective was to clarify associations between ID and cardiac remodeling in patients with ESKD. DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using 1974 Japanese patients with ESKD at the initiation of maintenance dialysis. Levels of hemoglobin (Hb), iron status, and cardiac enlargement as assessed by the cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) were determined immediately before the first hemodialysis session. Circulatory ID was defined as transferrin saturation (TSAT) < 20%, and stored ID was defined as ferritin level <100 ng/dL. RESULTS: The mean age was 67 years. Median CTR was 54.0%. The prevalence of circulatory and stored ID was found to be 38% and 34%, respectively. CTR was higher in patients with circulatory ID than in those without. Even in ESKD patients without overhydration, significant negative association was observed between TSAT and CTR. Higher odds ratios in parallel with higher CTR categories compared with the reference category of CTR <45% were found in patients with TSAT <20% on multinomial analysis, but ferritin did not show any significant associations.

Mechanistically, iron deficiency is linked to poor intestinal uptake, increased intestinal loss, and chronic inflammation. However, the prevalence of underlying gastrointestinal malignancies is not established in iron-deficient heart failure with or without anaemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients followed up in a single-centre, heart failure database with baseline registration of haemoglobin and iron status were retrospectively evaluated. The proportion of patients undergoing upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy between inclusion and censoring was determined. Afterwards, the prevalence of biopsy that confirmed intestinal malignancies in relation to baseline iron and haemoglobin status was determined. Anaemia was defined as a haemoglobin level <12 g/dL, and iron deficiency according to the aforementioned criteria. Of the 1197 patients in the database, 699 (59%) patients underwent full endoscopic workup over a mean follow-up of 50  27 months. A total of 50 intestinal malignancies were identified (n = 42, 84%, in iron-deficient vs. n = 8, 16%, non-iron-deficient patients; P < 0.001). The prevalence of intestinal malignancies was non-statistically different in iron-deficient patients with anaemia (n = 12/129, 9.3%) or without anaemia (n = 30/287, 10.5%; P = 0.551). The prevalence was much lower in patients without iron deficiency with anaemia (n = 5/83, 6%) or without anaemia (n = 3/200, 1.5%). In patients with iron deficiency but without anaemia (a group in which the role of endoscopic workup is less established), ferritin levels carried an inverse diagnostic capacity in detecting patients with an underlying malignancy (area under the curve = 0.741, P < 0.001). A ferritin level < 56 g/L had the best acuity, detecting malignancies with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 71%. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic evaluation is warranted in heart failure patients with iron-deficient anaemia given the high prevalence of underlying intestinal malignancies, as advised by gastroenterology guidelines.

However, the prevalence of underlying gastrointestinal malignancies is not established in iron-deficient heart failure with or without anaemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients followed up in a single-centre, heart failure database with baseline registration of haemoglobin and iron status were retrospectively evaluated. The proportion of patients undergoing upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy between inclusion and censoring was determined. Afterwards, the prevalence of biopsy that confirmed intestinal malignancies in relation to baseline iron and haemoglobin status was determined. Anaemia was defined as a haemoglobin level <12 g/dL, and iron deficiency according to the aforementioned criteria. Of the 1197 patients in the database, 699 (59%) patients underwent full endoscopic workup over a mean follow-up of 50  27 months. A total of 50 intestinal malignancies were identified (n = 42, 84%, in iron-deficient vs. n = 8, 16%, non-iron-deficient patients; P < 0.001). The prevalence of intestinal malignancies was non-statistically different in iron-deficient patients with anaemia (n = 12/129, 9.3%) or without anaemia (n = 30/287, 10.5%; P = 0.551). The prevalence was much lower in patients without iron deficiency with anaemia (n = 5/83, 6%) or without anaemia (n = 3/200, 1.5%). In patients with iron deficiency but without anaemia (a group in which the role of endoscopic workup is less established), ferritin levels carried an inverse diagnostic capacity in detecting patients with an underlying malignancy (area under the curve = 0.741, P < 0.001). A ferritin level < 56 g/L had the best acuity, detecting malignancies with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 71%. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic evaluation is warranted in heart failure patients with iron-deficient anaemia given the high prevalence of underlying intestinal malignancies, as advised by gastroenterology guidelines. However, additional research is needed assessing the best approach to patients with iron deficiency without anaemia, given the high occurrence of intestinal malignancies in these patients.

OBJECTIVE: This secondary outcome analysis aimed to compare the hemoglobin (Hb) and iron status [zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP)] of children born to women enrolled in the iLiNS-DYAD trial in Ghana. METHODS: Women =20 wk pregnant (n = 1320) were assigned to receive 60 mg Fe/d and 400 g folic acid/d until delivery and placebo thereafter, and no supplementation for infants (IFA group); or multiple micronutrients containing 20 mg Fe/d until 6 mo postpartum and no supplementation for infants (MMN); or small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNSs) containing 20 mg Fe/d until 6 mo postpartum, and SQ-LNSs for infants from 6 to 18 mo of age (LNS). We compared infants' Hb (g/L) and ZPP (mol/mol heme) at 6 and 18 mo of age. RESULTS: At 6 mo of age, groups did not differ in mean  SD Hb (overall: 113  9.9 g/L) or geometric mean (95% CI) ZPP [overall: 62.6 (60.6, 64.7)]. At 18 mo of age, mean  SD Hb (overall: 112  10.4 g/L) did not differ significantly between groups, whereas geometric mean (95% CI) ZPP was lower (P = 0.031) in the LNS group [53.9 (50.7, 57.3)] than the IFA [60.4 (56.7, 64.3)] but not the MMN [58.8 (55.6, 62.2)] group.

","BACKGROUND: Previous literature suggests a U-shaped relation between hemoglobin concentration and adverse birth outcomes. There is less evidence on associations between iron status and birth outcomes. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the associations of maternal hemoglobin concentration and iron status with birth outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a secondary data analysis of data from 2 cohorts of pregnant women receiving iron-containing nutritional supplements (20-60 mg ferrous sulfate) in Ghana (n = 1137) and Malawi (n = 1243). Hemoglobin concentration and 2 markers of iron status [zinc protoporphyrin and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR)] were measured at =20 weeks and 36 weeks of gestation. We used linear and Poisson regression models and birth outcomes included preterm birth (PTB), newborn stunting, low birth weight (LBW), and small-for-gestational-age. RESULTS: Prevalence of iron deficiency (sTfR >6.0 mg/L) at enrollment was 9% in Ghana and 20% in Malawi. In early pregnancy, iron deficiency was associated with PTB (9% compared with 17%, adjusted RR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.14, 2.33) and stunting (15% compared with 23%, adjusted RR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.94) in Malawi but not Ghana, and was not associated with LBW in either country; replete iron status (sTfR <10th percentile) was associated with stunting (9% compared with 15%, adjusted RR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.06, 2.77) in Ghana, but not PTB or LBW, and was not associated with any birth outcomes in Malawi.

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study that included 300 pregnant women in their first trimester and 163 babies. Maternal anthropometric and socioeconomic and newborns' data were collected. Complete blood count for study subjects and maternal serum ferritin were measured. RESULTS: The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia among pregnant women was 25.7% and 52% of them had depleted iron stores. When pregnant women were grouped into three hemoglobin (Hb) tertile groups, a significant difference was observed between maternal Hb and newborns' birth weight (P= 0.009), height (P= 0.022), head circumference (P= 0.017), and gestational age (P= 0.012). There was a significant association between maternal serum ferritin and frequency of low birth weight (P= 0.001) and frequency of preterm delivery (P= 0.003). No significant association was observed between maternal anthropometric measures or the socioeconomic status and pregnancy outcomes. CONCLUSION: Iron deficiency is a moderate public health problem among the study subjects. Maternal Hb and serum ferritin significantly affect pregnancy outcomes.",iron deficiency anemia among pregnant, ,".

Alongside the well-known pharmacological options (e.g. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, neprilysin inhibitors, beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists), which have significantly improved the clinical and prognostic outcomes of HFrEF patients, we now have a new therapeutic target: iron deficiency, defined as a ferritin concentration <100 g/l or between 100-300 g/l in the presence of a transferrin saturation <20%. Iron plays a major role in the transport of oxygen as a component of hemoglobin, as an oxygen reservoir, and as a component of myoglobin, as well as in the formation of energy, as a constituent of respiratory chain enzymes. Iron deficiency can therefore lead to anemia, changes in cognitive performance, behavior, emotions, reduced exercise capacity and myocardial structural and functional changes. Several clinical studies have shown that intravenous iron carboxymaltose supplementation can improve anemia, NYHA class, quality of life and exercise capacity of HFrEF patients. There are no randomized studies of adequate sample size that positively correlate iron supplementation with the higher endpoints of mortality and morbidity both in chronic and acute heart failure. Several studies are ongoing to answer these questions in the next few years.","heart failure, reduced ejection fraction, hfref, , clinical reality",   population,"Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction ( HFrEF ) is a clinical reality with an incidence of > 10 % in the population over 65 years of age , expected to increase in the coming years .

405,30997844_4,30997844, A prospective non-interventional study on the impact of transfusion burden and related iron toxicity on outcome in myelodysplastic syndromes undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation(). ,"Most myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)-patients receive multiple red blood cell transfusions (RBCT). Transfusions may cause iron-related toxicity and mortality, influencing outcome after allogeneic HSCT. This prospective non-interventional study evaluated 222 MDS and CMML patients undergoing HSCT. Overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), non-relapse mortality (NRM), and relapse incidence (RI) at 36 months were 52%, 44%, 25%, and 31%, respectively. Age, percentage of marrow blasts and severe comorbidities impacted OS. RFS was significantly associated with RBCT burden prior to HSCT (HR: 1.7; p = .02). High ferritin levels had a significant negative impact on OS and RI, but no impact on NRM. Administration of iron chelation therapy prior to HSCT did not influence the outcome, but early iron reduction after HSCT (started before 6 months) improved RFS significantly after transplantation (56% in the control group vs. 90% in the treated group, respectively; p = .04). This study illustrates the impact of RBCT and related parameters on HSCT-outcome. Patients with an expected prolonged survival after transplantation may benefit from early iron reduction therapy after transplantation.","transfusion burden, related iron toxicity,  myelodysplastic syndromes,red blood cell transfusions,overall survival,relapse free survival",myelodysplastic syndromes undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation evaluated 222  myelodysplastic syndromes  cmml patients,"and mortality , influencing outcome after allogeneic HSCT .

Although it is recommended to screen for ID in HF, there is no clear consensus on the optimal timing of its assessment. AIM: To analyse changes in iron status during a short-term follow-up in patients admitted for acute HF. METHODS: Iron status (serum ferritin concentration and transferrin saturation) was determined in 110 consecutive patients (median age: 81 years) admitted to a referral centre for acute HF, at three timepoints (admission, discharge and 1 month after discharge). ID was defined according to the guidelines. RESULTS: The prevalence rates of ID at admission, discharge and 1 month were, respectively, 75% (95% confidence interval [CI] 67-83%), 61% (95% CI: 52-70%), and 70% (95% CI: 61-79%) (P=0.008).

420,31162601_1,31162601," Early Life Child Micronutrient Status, Maternal Reasoning, and a Nurturing Household Environment have Persistent Influences on Child Cognitive Development at Age 5 years: Results from MAL-ED. ","BACKGROUND: Child cognitive development is influenced by early-life insults and protective factors. To what extent these factors have a long-term legacy on child development and hence fulfillment of cognitive potential is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the relation between early-life factors (birth to 2 y) and cognitive development at 5 y. METHODS: Observational follow-up visits were made of children at 5 y, previously enrolled in the community-based MAL-ED longitudinal cohort. The burden of enteropathogens, prevalence of illness, complementary diet intake, micronutrient status, and household and maternal factors from birth to 2 y were extensively measured and their relation with the Wechsler Preschool Primary Scales of Intelligence at 5 y was examined through use of linear regression. RESULTS: Cognitive T-scores from 813 of 1198 (68%) children were examined and 5 variables had significant associations in multivariable models: mean child plasma transferrin receptor concentration (: -1.81, 95% CI: -2.75, -0.86), number of years of maternal education (: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.08, 0.45), maternal cognitive reasoning score (: 0.09, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.15), household assets score (: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.24, 1.04), and HOME child cleanliness factor (: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.05, 1.15). In multivariable models, the mean rate of enteropathogen detections, burden of illness, and complementary food intakes between birth and 2 y were not significantly related to 5-y cognition. CONCLUSIONS: A nurturing home context in terms of a healthy/clean environment and household wealth, provision of adequate micronutrients, maternal education, and cognitive reasoning have a strong and persistent influence on child cognitive development. Efforts addressing aspects of poverty around micronutrient status, nurturing caregiving, and enabling home environments are likely to have lasting positive impacts on child cognitive development.",illness, ,"The burden of enteropathogens , prevalence of illness , complementary diet intake , micronutrient status , and household and maternal factors from birth to 2 y were extensively measured and their relation with the Wechsler Preschool Primary Scales of Intelligence at 5 y was examined through use of linear regression .

We sought to clarify the prevalence and impact of ID in patients with HFpEF. METHODS: A systematic search of Cohcrane, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and CINAHL electronic databases was performed to identify relevant studies. Included studies defined HFpEF as heart failure with an ejection fraction =50%. We used a random-effects meta-analysis to determine the composite prevalence of ID in patients with HFpEF across the included studies. Other outcomes were assessed with qualitative analysis due to a paucity of studies with comparable outcome measures. RESULTS: The prevalence of ID in the included studies was 59% (95% CI 52% to 65%). ID was associated with lower VO(2) max in three of four studies reporting VO(2) max as an outcome measure, lower functional status as determined by dyspnoea class or 6 min walk test in two of three studies, and worse health-related quality of life in both studies reporting on this outcome. Conversely, ID had no impact on death or hospitalisation in three of the four studies investigating this.

METHODS: Ninety-three patients with infection who had a quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score =2 were enrolled. Plasma phenylalanine, leucine, albumin, C-reactive protein, pre-albumin, and transferrin were measured and the SOFA score at enrollment was calculated after hospitalization. RESULTS: During the 3-month follow-up, 30 (32.3%) patients died. Death was associated with higher SOFA scores, a higher incidence of bacteremia and admission to the intensive care unit, higher C-reactive protein and phenylalanine levels, worse kidney function, and lower pre-albumin and transferrin levels. Patients were categorized into three groups: high-risk type 1 (phenylalanine =84M), high-risk type 2 (phenylalanine <84M and leucine <93M), and low-risk (other). Compared to the low-risk type patients, high-risk type 1 and 2 patients had higher mortality rates (hazard ratio 10.1 (95% CI 2.33-43.5) and hazard ratio 5.56 (95% CI 1.22-25.4), respectively). Type 1 patients had higher SOFA scores, a higher incidence of admission to the intensive care unit, and higher C-reactive protein and leucine levels. Type 2 patients had lower albumin and hemoglobin levels. Multivariable analysis showed that both high-risk types were independent predictors of death.

Short-term evaluation of the laparoscopic procedure showed low morbidity and satisfactory results on weight loss. Evidence of the validity of the technique in the longer term is scarce. METHODS: Data from patients who underwent M&M procedure from May 2012 to September 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Preoperative clinical characteristics and data up to 4 years after operation were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 132 patients were included in this study with a mean age of 46  13.4 years. The mean body mass index (BMI) at the time of procedure was 43  4.5 kg/m(2). Mean percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) was 67, 67, 58, and 57% at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years, respectively.

Short-term evaluation of the laparoscopic procedure showed low morbidity and satisfactory results on weight loss. Evidence of the validity of the technique in the longer term is scarce. METHODS: Data from patients who underwent M&M procedure from May 2012 to September 2015 were retrospectively reviewed.

SUBJECTS/METHODS: Three hundred and sixty-six women participating in a randomised trial of vitamin B(12) supplementation were monitored to assess haemoglobin (Hb), serum ferritin (SF), hepcidin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) during pregnancy. Women received vitamin B(12) supplementation (50 g per day) or placebo daily; all women received daily prenatal iron-folic acid supplementation. Binomial and linear regression models were used to examine the associations of maternal iron biomarkers with pregnancy and infant outcomes. RESULTS: Thirty percent of women were anaemic (Hb < 11.0 g/dl), 48% were iron deficient (SF < 15.0 g/l), and 23% had iron deficiency anaemia at their first prenatal visit. The prevalence of inflammation (CRP > 5.0 mg/l: 17%; AGP > 1.0 g/l: 11%) and anaemia of inflammation (Hb < 11.0 g/dl, SF > 15.0 g/l, plus CRP > 5.0 mg/l or AGP > 1.0 g/l: 2%) were low. Infants born to anaemic women had a twofold higher risk of low birth weight (<2500 g; risk ratio [RR]: 2.15, 95%CI: 1.20-3.84, p = 0.01), preterm delivery (RR: 2.67 (1.43-5.00); p = 0.002), underweight (WAZ < -2; RR: 2.20, 95%CI: 1.16-4.15, p = 0.02), and lower MUAC ((SE): -0.94 (0.45)cm, p = 0.03). Similarly, maternal Hb concentrations predicted higher infant birth weight (p = 0.02) and greater gestational age at delivery ((SE): 0.28 (0.08) weeks, p = 0.001), lower risk of preterm delivery (<37 weeks; RR: 0.76, 95%CI: 0.66-86, p < 0.0001); and higher infant MUAC ((SE): 0.36 (0.13) cm, p = 0.006). Maternal SF concentrations were associated with greater birth length ((SE): 0.44 (0.20) cm, p < 0.03). Findings were similar after adjusting SF concentrations for inflammation.

","Heart failure (HF) is a chronic medical condition affecting an estimated 1-2% of the world's population, and as many as 10% of patients age 65 and above. Among patients with HF, iron deficiency (ID) has an estimated prevalence of 30-83%, often without concomitant anemia. Thus, ID in HF is often underdiagnosed unless actively sought after. ID in HF has been shown to be an independent contributor of increased mortality, hospitalization, and early readmission compared with HF patients without ID or HF patients with anemia without ID. Previous trials suggest that intravenous iron supplementation for patients with chronic HF and ID with or without anemia has resulted in improved functional outcomes and quality of life; however, the role of iron supplementation in patients hospitalized with HF has not been well characterized. In this retrospective analysis conducted in a large urban health system, we show that of the greater than 10,000 patients admitted for HF in 1 year, only 158 patients underwent screening for ID. Of these, 109 met criteria for ID. Despite intravenous iron being the standard of care for treatment of ID in HF patients, only 23 patients received this therapy.

METHODS: Thirty-four patients with severe heart failure (grade III-IV of cardiac function) and pulmonary infections undergoing mechanical ventilation admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine from May 2017 to April 2018 were enrolled. They were randomly divided into EEN group and delayed enteral nutrition (DEN) group. Both groups were given routine treatment, including mechanical ventilation, improvement of cardiac function, anti-infection, protection of vital organ function, regulation of blood sugar and adjustment of electrolyte and acid-base balance. The patients in EEN group received enteral nutrition (EN) within 48 hours after ICU admission, and in DEN group, EN was started after the patients had spent the early stage of stress and had stable vital signs (48 hours after ICU admission). The changes in serum B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), C-reactive protein (CRP), nutritional indicators and liver function indicators at ICU admission and 7 days after treatment were compared between the two groups. The time needed for patients to reach EN target, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, and the 28-day mortality were recorded, and complications were observed.

442,31556953_1,31556953," Iron deficiency in worsening heart failure is associated with reduced estimated protein intake, fluid retention, inflammation, and antiplatelet use. ","AIMS: Iron deficiency (ID) is common in heart failure (HF) patients and negatively impacts symptoms and prognosis. The aetiology of ID in HF is largely unknown. We studied determinants and the biomarker profile of ID in a large international HF cohort. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 2357 worsening HF patients from the BIOSTAT-CHF cohort. ID was defined as transferrin saturation <20%. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to identify determinants for ID. We measured 92 cardiovascular markers (Olink Cardiovascular III) to establish a biomarker profile of ID. The primary endpoint was the composite of all-cause mortality and first HF rehospitalization. Mean age (standard deviation) of all patients was 69  12.0 years, 26.1% were female and median N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide levels (+interquartile range) were 4305 (2360-8329) ng/L. Iron deficiency was present in 1453 patients (61.6%), with highest prevalence in females (71.1% vs. 58.3%; P < 0.001). Independent determinants of ID were female sex, lower estimated protein intake, higher heart rate, presence of peripheral oedema and orthopnoea, chronic kidney disease, lower haemoglobin, higher C-reactive protein levels, lower serum albumin levels, and P2Y12 inhibitor use (all P < 0.05).

The relevance of iron deficiency, however, is ill defined. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the impact of iron deficiency (ferritin <100 g L(-1)) with or without concomitant anaemia on clinical outcome after cardiac surgery. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, 730 patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery were assigned into four groups according to their iron status and anaemia. Mortality, serious adverse events (SAEs), major cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs), allogenic blood transfusion requirements, and length of hospital stay were assessed during a 90-day follow-up period. The effect of iron deficiency on these outcomes was first calculated in models adjusting for anaemia only, followed by two multivariate models adjusting for anaemia and either the EuroSCORE II or any possible confounders. RESULTS: The presence of iron deficiency (ferritin <100 g L(-1)) was associated with an increase in 90-day mortality from 2% to 5% in patients without anaemia, and from 4% to 14% in patients with anaemia.

","OBJECTIVES: Cyanotic congenital heart disease (CCHD) predisposes patients to iron deficiency due to compensatory secondary erythrocytosis. This study aimed to determine the serum iron status and prevalence of iron deficiency among children with cyanotic congenital heart disease attending the Paediatric Cardiology outpatient clinic of Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Lagos, Nigeria. METHODS: This cross-sectional case-control study took place between May and October 2015 at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital. A total of 75 children with cyanotic congenital heart disease and 75 apparently healthy age-, gender- and socioeconomically-matched controls were analysed to determine serum iron status and the prevalence of iron deficiency as defined by the World Health Organization criteria. RESULTS: The mean age of the children was 47.5  2.9 months (range: 6-144 months old). Iron deficiency was significantly more frequent among CCHD patients compared to control subjects (9.3% versus 0%; P = 0.006). While latent iron deficiency was more prevalent among children in the control group compared to those with CCHD, this difference was not statistically significant (13.3% versus 9.3%; P = 0.303). No cases of iron deficiency anaemia were observed in the studied sample. CONCLUSION: Neither the children in the control group nor those with CCHD had iron deficiency anaemia.

454,32331365_1,32331365, Iron Deficiency: Impact on Functional Capacity and Quality of Life in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction. LI,"The effects of iron deficiency (ID) have been widely studied in heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction. On the other hand, studies in HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) are few and have included small numbers of participants. The aim of this study was to assess the role that ID plays in functional capacity and quality of life (QoL) in HFpEF while comparing several iron-related biomarkers to be used as potential predictors. ID was defined as ferritin <100 ng/mL or transferrin saturation <20%. Submaximal exercise capacity, measured by the 6-min walking test (6MWT), and QoL, assessed by the Minnesotta Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ), were compared between iron deficient patients and patients with normal iron status. A total of 447 HFpEF patients were included in the present cross-sectional study, and ID prevalence was 73%. Patients with ID performed worse in the 6MWT compared to patients with normal iron status (ID 271  94 m vs. non-ID 310  108 m, p < 0.01). They also scored higher in the MLHFQ, denoting worse QoL (ID 49  22 vs. non-ID 43  23, p = 0.01). Regarding iron metabolism biomarkers, serum soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) was the strongest independent predictor of functional capacity ( = -63, p < 0.0001, R(2) 0.39) and QoL ( = 7.95, p < 0.0001, R(2) 0.14) in multivariate models. This study postulates that ID is associated with worse functional capacity and QoL in HFpEF as well, and that sTfR is the best iron-related biomarker to predict both. Our study also suggests that the effects of ID could differ among HFpEF patients by left ventricular ejection fraction.","iron deficiency,heart failure,living, heart failure questionnaire,",heart failure  preserved e  compared  iron deficient patients,"exercise capacity , measured by the 6-min walking test ( 6MWT ) , and QoL , assessed by the Minnesotta Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire ( MLHFQ ) , were compared between iron deficient patients and patients with normal iron status .

Potential strategies are available to manipulate phenylalanine metabolism. This study investigated whether increased phenylalanine predicted mortality in critical patients with either acute heart failure (HF) or acute on chronic HF, and its correlation with inflammation and immune cytokines. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study recruited 152 subjects, including 115 patients with HF admitted for critical conditions and 37 normal controls. We measured left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), plasma concentrations of phenylalanine, C-reactive protein, albumin, pre-albumin, transferrin, and pro-inflammatory and immune cytokines. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), and maximal vasoactive-inotropic scores (VIS(max) ) were calculated. Patients were followed up until death or a maximum of 1 year. The primary endpoint was all-cause death. Of the 115 patients, 37 (32.2%) were admitted owing to acute HF, and 78 (67.8%) were admitted owing to acute on chronic HF; 64 (55.7%) had ST elevation/non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. An LVEF measured during the hospitalization of <40%, 40-50%, and =50% was noted in 51 (44.3%), 15 (13.1%), and 49 (42.6%) patients, respectively. During 1 year follow-up, 51 (44.3%) patients died. Death was associated with higher APACHE II, SOFA, and VIS(max) scores; higher levels of C-reactive protein and phenylalanine; higher incidence of atrial fibrillation and use of inotropic agents; lower cholesterol, albumin, pre-albumin, and transferrin levels; and significant changes in pro-inflammatory and immune cytokines. Phenylalanine levels demonstrated an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 for mortality, with an optimal cut-off value set at 112 M. Phenylalanine = 112 M was associated with a higher mortality rate than was phenylalanine < 112 M (80.5% vs. 24.3%, P < 0.001) [hazard ratio = 5.07 (2.83-9.05), P < 0.001]. The Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that phenylalanine = 112 M was associated with a lower accumulative survival rate (log rank = 36.9, P < 0.001). Higher phenylalanine levels were correlated with higher APACHE II and SOFA scores, higher C-reactive protein levels and incidence of using inotropic agents, and changes in cytokines suggestive of immunosuppression, but lower levels of pre-albumin and transferrin. Further multivariable analysis showed that phenylalanine = 112 M predicted death over 1 year independently of age, APACHE II and SOFA scores, atrial fibrillation, C-reactive protein, cholesterol, pre-albumin, transferrin, and interleukin-8 and interleukin-10.

464,32621487_1,32621487, Impaired Hematological Status Increases the Risk of Mortality among HIV-Infected Adults Initiating Antiretroviral Therapy in Tanzania. ,"BACKGROUND: Hematological status may predict HIV disease progression and mortality among adults initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine the relation of anemia and iron status at HAART initiation with survival and morbidity outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a case-cohort study of 570 HIV-infected adults initiating HAART who were enrolled in a trial of multivitamins in Tanzania. Hemoglobin, serum ferritin, and hepcidin concentrations were assessed at HAART initiation and participants were followed up monthly. We adjusted serum ferritin for inflammation using a regression correction method to characterize hematological status. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate HRs for mortality and incident clinical outcomes. RESULTS: We found an 83% prevalence of anemia, 15% prevalence of iron deficiency anemia, and 66% prevalence of anemia of chronic diseases (ACD). The prevalence of elevated iron was 33% and 19% had iron deficiency (ID). After multivariate adjustment, severe anemia (HR: 2.57; 95% CI: 1.49, 4.45) and ACD (HR: 4.71; 95% CI: 2.91, 7.62) were associated with increased risk of mortality as compared with nonanemic participants. In addition, both ID (HR: 2.65; 95% CI: 1.08, 7.78) and elevated iron (HR: 2.83; 95% CI: 2.10, 3.82) were associated with increased risk of mortality as compared with normal iron concentrations. Severe anemia and elevated iron concentrations were associated with incident wasting and >10% weight loss (P values <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Anemia and both ID and elevated iron were associated with increased mortality among HIV-infected adults initiating HAART.

Intravenous iron repletion improves clinical status in HF patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) =45%. However, uncertainty exists about the accuracy of serum biomarkers in diagnosing ID. The aims of this study were (i) to identify the iron biomarker with the greatest accuracy for the diagnosis of ID in bone marrow in patients with ischaemic HF, and (ii) to establish the prevalence of ID using this biomarker and its prognostic value in HF patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bone marrow was stained for iron in 30 patients with ischaemic HF with LVEF =45% and 10 healthy controls, and ID was diagnosed for 0-1 grades (Gale scale). A total of 791 patients with HF with LVEF =45% were prospectively followed up for 3 years. Serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) were assessed as iron biomarkers. Most patients with HF (n = 25, 83%) had ID in bone marrow, but none of the controls (P < 0.001). Serum sTfR had the best accuracy in predicting ID in bone marrow (area under the curve 0.920, 95% confidence interval 0.761-0.987, for cut-off 1.25 mg/L sensitivity 84%, specificity 100%). Serum sTfR was =1.25 mg/L in 47% of HF patients, in 56% and 46% of anaemics and non-anaemics, respectively (P < 0.05). The reclassification methods revealed that serum sTfR significantly added the prognostic value to the baseline prognostic model, and to the greater extent than plasma N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide. Based on internal derivation and validation procedures, serum sTfR =1.41 mg/L was the optimal threshold for predicting 3-year mortality, independent of other established variables. CONCLUSIONS: High serum sTfR accurately reflects depleted iron stores in bone marrow in patients with HF, and identifies those with a high 3-year mortality.","iron deficiency using,  iron deficiency,heart failure,left ventricular ejection fraction,", patients  heart failure: id  bone marrow  patients,"( LVEF ) = 45 % .

480,33195716_1,33195716, Prevalence of Female Athlete Triad Risk Factors and Iron Supplementation Among High School Distance Runners: Results From a Triad Risk Screening Tool. ,"BACKGROUND: Investigations of the female athlete triad (Triad) in high school athletes have found that 36% had low energy availability, 54% had menstrual abnormalities, and 16% had low bone mineral density (BMD). Limited data are available showing the prevalence of these risk factors in high school distance runners or regarding best practice on screening for the Triad in the adolescent population. PURPOSE: To (1) evaluate the prevalence of Triad risk factors and iron supplementation in high school distance runners and (2) pilot a screening tool for Triad risk score. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiology study. METHODS: The study population included female high school athletes who participated in cross-country/track. Participants completed a survey including questions regarding dietary habits, menstrual history, and bone stress injury (BSI) history. They then underwent evaluation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, free triiodothyronine (T(3)), and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan to measure body fat and BMD through use of age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched Z scores. Triad scores were calculated. Relationships were analyzed using Spearman correlation coefficient. RESULTS: There were 38 study participants (mean age, 16.9 years). Average body mass index was 19.8 kg/m(2). Disordered eating or eating disorders were reported in 76.3% of runners; in addition, 23.7% reported delayed menarche, 45.9% had a history of amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, 42.1% had low BMD (Z score < -1.0), and 15.8% reported prior BSI. Low free T(3) was significantly associated with higher Triad risk scores (r (S) = -0.36; P = .028). More than 42% of athletes were supplementing iron. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of Triad risk factors in high school distance runners was high. Free T(3) was inversely associated with Triad score, which may serve as an indicator of low energy availability. Nearly half of the athletes were using iron supplementation.","risk factors, high, bone mineral density,bone stress injury,r,",  adolescent population,"BACKGROUND : Investigations of the female athlete triad ( Triad ) in high school athletes have found that 36 % had low energy availability , 54 % had menstrual abnormalities , and 16 % had low bone mineral density ( BMD ) .

The work aims to study the association of TNF-<U+0251> G-308 A gene polymorphism with the course and outcome of COVID-19 patients in Mansoura University Hospital. METHODS: 900 patients with COVID-19 infection and 184 controls were tested for TNF-<U+0251> G-308 A promoter polymorphism. Different genotypes of TNF-<U+0251> G-308 A were compared as regards the severity and prognosis of the disease. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was found between patients and controls as regards the demographic data. The AA genotype of TNF-<U+0251> showed a higher incidence of the disease in comparison to the other genotypes. As regards the demographic and laboratory characters, no statistically significant difference was found between the different genotypes except for age, lymphopenia, CRP, and serum ferritin levels. In 336(80.0%) cases of the AA genotype, the disease was severe in comparison to 90(41.7%) cases in the GA genotype and no cases in the GG genotype with P = .001. CONCLUSION: People who carry the A allele of TNF-<U+0251> polymorphism are more prone to COVID-19 infection.

The aims of this study were (1) to evaluate the prevalence, types, and confounding factors of ID and anemia in patients referred to cardio-oncology clinic, and (2) identify the association between iron metabolism parameters and survival of cardio-oncology patients. METHODS: We assessed iron, ferritin, hemoglobin concentrations, transferrin saturation (TSAT), cancer type, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), kidney function, cardiovascular risk factors and survival in 599 patients who were referred to cardio-oncology clinic from 2011 to 2017. ID was defined by a TSAT < 20%, absolute iron deficiency (AID) with a serum ferritin level < 100 g/L while serum ferritin level of = 100 g/L was considered as functional iron deficiency (FID) and TSAT = 20% was considered as no ID. RESULTS: The prevalence of ID, AID, and FID was 46, 31, and 15% of study patients, respectively. Anemia was present in approximately half (54%) of the patients with any ID. Multivariate Cox analyses showed that male gender (HR 1.704 [1.207-2.404] p = 0.002); previous cancer history (HR 1.879 [1.079-3.272] p = 0.026); elevated BNP (HR 2.126 [1.258-3.590] p = 0.005); TSAT< 20% (HR 1.721 [1.214-2.439] p = 0.002); ferritin = 100 g/L (HR 2.008 [1.088-3.706] p = 0.026); serum iron concentration < 12 mol/L (HR 2.292 [1.614-3.255] p < 0.001); FID (HR 2.538 [1.1618-3.981] p < 0.001) and anemia (HR 2.462 [1.734-3.495] p < 0.001) were significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause death.

489,33292849_3,33292849, The prevalence of iron deficiency and anemia and their impact on survival in patients at a cardio-oncology clinic. ,"BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency (ID) and anemia are common in both heart failure (HF) and cancer patients and are associated with poor quality of life and survival. The aims of this study were (1) to evaluate the prevalence, types, and confounding factors of ID and anemia in patients referred to cardio-oncology clinic, and (2) identify the association between iron metabolism parameters and survival of cardio-oncology patients. METHODS: We assessed iron, ferritin, hemoglobin concentrations, transferrin saturation (TSAT), cancer type, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), kidney function, cardiovascular risk factors and survival in 599 patients who were referred to cardio-oncology clinic from 2011 to 2017. ID was defined by a TSAT < 20%, absolute iron deficiency (AID) with a serum ferritin level < 100 g/L while serum ferritin level of = 100 g/L was considered as functional iron deficiency (FID) and TSAT = 20% was considered as no ID. RESULTS: The prevalence of ID, AID, and FID was 46, 31, and 15% of study patients, respectively. Anemia was present in approximately half (54%) of the patients with any ID. Multivariate Cox analyses showed that male gender (HR 1.704 [1.207-2.404] p = 0.002); previous cancer history (HR 1.879 [1.079-3.272] p = 0.026); elevated BNP (HR 2.126 [1.258-3.590] p = 0.005); TSAT< 20% (HR 1.721 [1.214-2.439] p = 0.002); ferritin = 100 g/L (HR 2.008 [1.088-3.706] p = 0.026); serum iron concentration < 12 mol/L (HR 2.292 [1.614-3.255] p < 0.001); FID (HR 2.538 [1.1618-3.981] p < 0.001) and anemia (HR 2.462 [1.734-3.495] p < 0.001) were significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause death. CONCLUSIONS: About half of cardio-oncology patients had anemia and iron deficiency, with the absolute type being twice as prevalent as the functional one. Patients with breast, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary cancer were affected more often. Both anemia and iron deficiency independently predicted all-cause mortality. Future studies are required to confirm ID as a risk factor and evaluate the clinical benefits of iron replacement therapy.","iron deficiency, iron deficiency,heart failure,transferrin saturation,brain natriuretic peptide",patients   cardio oncology   study patients,"ferritin level of = 100 g / L was considered as functional iron deficiency ( FID ) and TSAT = 20 % was considered as no ID .

490,33344390_1,33344390, Serum Ferritin Predicts Neither Organ Dysfunction Nor Mortality in Pediatric Sepsis Due to Tropical Infections. ,"Objective: To evaluate serial ferritin levels measured in the initial 72 h of admission as a biomarker for new and progressive multi organ dysfunction syndrome (NPMODS) and mortality (unfavorable outcomes) in critically ill children with sepsis due to tropical infections. Material and Methods: In this prospective observational study from a tertiary care teaching hospital in India, children 3 month to 12 years with a diagnosis of acute febrile illness and any two features suggesting tropical infections [cytopenia (platelet count <1,00,000/cu.mm, total leucocyte count <4,000/cu.mm), hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, systemic signs (rash, edema), respiratory distress, and encephalopathy not accounted by localized infection] were eligible for inclusion. Children with known or suspected disorder of iron metabolism were excluded. Primary outcome was to determine the association of serial ferritin levels with mortality and NPMODS. Secondary outcomes included estimation of the prevalence of hyperferritinemia and comparison of risk prediction scores with serial ferritin measurement in predicting unfavorable outcomes. Measurements and Main Results: In the 202 children enrolled, diagnosis could be established in 133 (65.8%) children. Scrub typhus and dengue were the most common infections. Median (IQR) ferritin measured at admission (n = 183) and on day 3 (n = 120) of hospital stay were 798 (378, 3,205) g/L and 429 (213,680) g/L, respectively. Majority (n = 180, 89.1%) had MODS at admission defined as per International pediatric sepsis consensus conference. NPMODS occurred in 47 (23.3%) children of whom 37 (18.3%) died. Children with three or less organ dysfunctions had lower mortality. Neither admission ferritin values nor the percentage change over 72 h was different between children with favorable and unfavorable outcomes. Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM-III) and daily Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score (dPELOD2 score) were significantly different in those with unfavorable outcomes. Admission ferritin levels and percentage change in 72 h had poor discriminatory power for mortality with AUC of 0.53 (0.53, 0.67) and 0.50 (0.50, 0.64), respectively. dPELOD2 had the best discriminatory power for mortality with AUC of 0.89 (0.89, 0.95). Conclusions: Serial ferritin estimation predicted neither organ dysfunction nor mortality in pediatric sepsis with tropical infections. dPELOD-2 and PRISM-III predicted unfavorable outcomes better than ferritin. The current diagnostic criteria for MODS overestimated organ dysfunctions in tropical infections and hence may need modification with further validation in this epidemiological cohort.","hyperferritinemia, comparison, risk, progressive multi organ dysfunction syndrome,median,",predicts neither organ dysfunc ,"excluded .

It remains unclear whether ID also affects the outcome after elective cardiac surgery. METHODS: A total of 378 consecutive patients undergoing either coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) were prospectively enrolled, and blood samples were taken before surgery for analysis of iron metabolism. Incidence of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) was defined as the primary endpoint of the study. RESULTS: ID (ferritin < 100 ng/ml or ferritin = 100-299 ng/ml and transferrin saturation < 20%) was common in cardiac surgery patients (ID, n = 265, 70%) and related to significant decreased preoperative hemoglobin values (ID: 13.6  1.6 g/dl, Non-ID: 14.3  1.5 g/dl, p < 0.01).

Differences in prevalence of ID across various groups were assessed using Chi-squared test for categorical variables and equality of means for continuous variables with p-values <0.05 considered statistically significant. Results: A total of 187 persons =20 years, corresponding to a 5.57million had HF. The prevalence of ID was 48.17% (95% CI 36.84-59.69) and the prevalence of anemia was 12.08%(95% CI 8.16-17.53). Diabetics (61.03%) were more likely to have ID compared to nondiabetics (35.38%), p 0.022. The prevalence of ID was similar in persons with anemia (47.45%) and persons without anemia (48.27%), p-value 0.983. The prevalence of ID has been constant for at least the past 20 years, making ID in HF an underdiagnose and/or undertreated condition among patients with HF and should be addressed. Conclusions: One in every two persons with HF has ID. Also, prevalence of ID was similar in patients with anemia and without anemia.

505,33619905_1,33619905, Diagnosis and Treatment of Iron Deficiency in Heart Failure: OFICSel study by the French Heart Failure Working Group. ,"AIMS: Iron deficiency (ID) occurs in about 50% of patients with heart failure (HF). The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends ID diagnostic testing in newly diagnosed patients with HF and during follow-up, with intravenous iron supplementation (IS) only recommended in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). This study aimed to assess prevalence, clinical characteristics, and application of ESC guidelines for ID and IS in patients with HF in the real-life clinical setting. METHODS AND RESULTS: The French transversal multicentre OFICSel registry (300 cardiologists) conducted in 2017 included patients hospitalized for HF at least once in the previous 5 years. Diverse adult patients were eligible including inpatients and outpatients and those with acute and chronic HF. Data were collected from cardiologists and patients using study-specific surveys. Data included demographic and clinical data, as well as HF and ID management data. Overall, 2822 patients, mainly male (69.3%) with a median age of 69 years (interquartile range 58-78), were included. A total of 1075 patients (38.1%) were tested for ID, with 364 (33.9%) diagnosed. Of these, 168 (46.2%) received IS: 128 (76.2%) intravenous IS and 40 (23.8%) oral. Among the 201 patients with HFrEF diagnosed with ID, 99 (49.3%) received IS: 79 (79.8%) intravenous IS and 20 (20.2%) oral. CONCLUSIONS: In clinical practice, only one-third of patients with HF had a diagnostic test for ID. In patients with ID with HFrEF, only 39.3% received intravenous IS as recommended. Thus, in general, cardiologists should be encouraged to follow the ESC guidelines to ensure optimal treatment for patients with HF.","iron deficiency,heart failure,society, cardiology,iron supplementation",heart failure: oficsel study b  patients,"about 50 % of patients with heart failure ( HF ) .

506,33659229_1,33659229, Combined Associations of Serum Ferritin and Body Size Phenotypes With Cardiovascular Risk Profiles: A Chinese Population-Based Study. ,"Background: Serum ferritin (SF) has been correlated with one or more metabolic syndrome features associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study explored the associations between SF and CVD risk factors among different body size phenotypes that were based on metabolic status and body mass index (BMI) categories. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed using a cohort of 7,549 Chinese adults from the China Health and Nutrition Survey. Participants did not exhibit acute inflammation, were not underweight and were stratified based on their metabolic status and BMI categories. The metabolically at-risk status was defined as having two or more criteria of the Adult Treatment Panel-III metabolic syndrome definition, excluding waist circumference. Results: Compared with individuals without high SF, subjects with high SF had an increased risk of diabetes in the metabolically at-risk normal-weight (MANW) and metabolically at-risk overweight/obesity (MAO) groups. The multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were 1.52 [95% confidence interval (Cls): 1.02, 2.28] and 1.63 (95% Cls: 1.27, 2.09), respectively. Adjusted ORs for hyperuricemia from high SF in metabolically healthy normal-weight (MHNW), metabolically healthy overweight/obesity (MHO), MANW, and MAO phenotypes were 1.78 (95% Cls: 1.26, 2.53), 1.42 (95% Cls: 1.03, 1.95), 1.66 (95% Cls: 1.17, 2.36), and 1.42 (95% Cls: 1.17, 1.73), respectively. Similarly, positive correlations of high SF with triglycerides, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B100 were observed in all phenotypes. No association between high SF and elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were observed among participants who were metabolically at-risk, regardless of their BMI categories. However, the ORs for elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol from high SF were 1.64 (95% Cls: 1.29, 2.08) in the MHNW group and 1.52 (95% Cls:1.22, 1.91) in the MHO group, significantly. This study demonstrated that the highest ORs were in MAO with a high SF group for all unfavorable CVD risk factors except low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (all p < 0.001). Conclusions: The associations of high SF with the prevalence of CVD risk factors, including diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hyperuricemia, vary in individuals among different body size phenotypes. In the MAO group, subjects with high SF levels exhibited worse CVD risk profiles than individuals without high SF.","serum ferritin, body size phenotypes,  cardiovascular disease risk factors, serum ferritin,cardiovascular disease,body mass index, risk normal weight", body size phenotypes   ,"group and 1.52 ( 95 % Cls : 1.22 , 1.91 ) in the MHO group , significantly .

511,33777967_1,33777967, Optimizing Management to Reduce the Mortality of COVID-19: Experience From a Designated Hospital for Severely and Critically Ill Patients in China. ,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has swept through the world at a tremendous speed, and there is still limited data available on the treatment for COVID-19. The mortality of severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients in the Optical Valley Branch of Tongji Hospital was low. We aimed to analyze the available treatment strategies to reduce mortality. Methods: In this retrospective, single-center study, we included 1,106 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Optical Valley Branch of Tongji Hospital from February 9 to March 9, 2020. Cases were analyzed for demographic and clinical features, laboratory data, and treatment methods. Outcomes were followed up until March 29, 2020. Results: Inflammation-related indices (hs-CRP, ESR, serum ferritin, and procalcitonin) were significantly higher in severe and critically ill patients than those in moderate patients. The levels of cytokines, including IL-6, IL2R, IL-8, and TNF-a, were also higher in the critical patients. Incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the severely and critically ill group was 23.0% (99/431). Sixty-one patients underwent invasive mechanical ventilation. The correlation between SpO(2)/FiO(2) and PaO(2)/FiO(2) was confirmed, and the cut-off value of SpO(2)/FiO(2) related to survival was 134.43. The mortality of patients with low SpO(2)/FiO(2) (<134.43) at intubation was higher than that of patients with high SpO(2)/FiO(2) (>134.43) (72.7 vs. 33.3%). Among critical patients, the application rates of glucocorticoid therapy, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and anticoagulation treatment reached 55.2% (238/431), 7.2% (31/431), and 37.1% (160/431), respectively. Among the intubated patients, the application rates of glucocorticoid therapy, CRRT, and anticoagulation treatment were respectively 77.0% (47/61), 54.1% (33/61), and 98.4% (60/61). Conclusion: No vaccines or specific antiviral drugs for COVID-19 have been shown to be sufficiently safe and effective to date. Comprehensive treatment including ventilatory support, multiple organ function preservation, glucocorticoid use, renal replacement therapy, anticoagulation, and restrictive fluid management was the main treatment strategy. Early recognition and intervention, multidisciplinary collaboration, multi-organ function support, and personalized treatment might be the key for reducing mortality.","acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome,continuous renal replacement therapy,",  severe  critically ill patients,"ferritin , and procalcitonin ) were significantly higher in severe and critically ill patients than those in moderate patients .

Disease diagnosis and estimating patients at higher risk is important for the optimal management during the pandemic. This study aimed to identify the predictors of mortality and length of hospital stay in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted between March 2020 and August 2020 at Al-Noor Specialist Hospital in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. All patients who were admitted and had a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis by a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were included in the study. Descriptive statistics were used to describe patients' demographic characteristics, laboratory findings, and clinical outcomes. Multiple logistic/linear regression analysis was used to identify predictors of death and length of stay at the hospital. RESULTS: A total of 706 patients were hospitalised for COVID-19. The mean age was 48.0 years (SD: 15.6 years). More than half of the patients (68.5%; n= 292) were males. The median duration of stay at the hospital was 6.0 days (IQR: 300-10:00). The prevalence rate of venous thromboembolism (VTE) among the patients was 3.0% (n= 21).

519,34003690_1,34003690, Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial of Ferric Carboxymaltose in Heart Failure With Iron Deficiency: Rationale and Design. ,"BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency (ID) has a prevalence of 40% to 50% among patients in heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction and is associated with worse prognosis. Several trials demonstrated that intravenous ferric carboxymaltose leads to early and sustained improvement in patient-reported outcomes and functional capacity in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction with ID, yet morbidity and mortality data are limited. METHODS: The objective of the HEART-FID trial (Ferric Carboxymaltose in Heart Failure With Iron Deficiency) is to assess efficacy and safety of ferric carboxymaltose compared with placebo as treatment for symptomatic HF with reduced ejection fraction with ID. HEART-FID is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolling 3014 patients at 300 international centers. Eligible patients are aged =18 years in stable chronic HF with New York Heart Association functional class II to IV symptoms, ejection fraction =40%, ID (ferritin <100 ng/mL or ferritin 100-300 ng/mL with a transferrin saturation <20%), and documented HF hospitalization or elevated N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide. Consented patients are assigned to ferric carboxymaltose or placebo at baseline, with repeated visits/assessments every 6 months for additional study drug based on hemoglobin and iron indices for the trial duration. The primary end point is a hierarchical composite of death and HF hospitalization at 12 months and change from baseline to 6 months in the 6-minute walk test distance. CONCLUSIONS: The HEART-FID trial will inform clinical practice by clarifying the role of long-term treatment with intravenous ferric carboxymaltose, added to usual care, in ambulatory patients with symptomatic HF with reduced ejection fraction with ID.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study using database that included: demographic, clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, medications and clinical outcomes of all patients hospitalized in Royal Hospital, Muscat, Oman, between March 12, 2020 and December 1st 2020. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed to investigate the relationship between each variable and the risk of death of COVID-19 infected patients. RESULTS: In total,1002 patients with COVID-19 infection with mean age of the cohort was 5416 years (65% (n=650) male) were included, with an overall and intensive care unit (ICU) mortalities of 26% (n=257) and 42% (n=199/473), respectively. The prevalence of ICU admission was 47% (n=473) and the need for mechanical ventilation was 41% (n=413). The overall length of stay in the ICU was 13 (9-21) days.

Methods: A total of 215 consecutive patients with HFpEF, who visited the cardiovascular outpatient department of Beijing Anzhen Hospital, were enrolled in this prospective study. The plasma ferritin level and transferin saturation were measured. Patients were divided into two groups: ID group and non-ID group. ID patients were further divided into absolute ID subgroup and functional ID subgroup. Patients were followed up to 1 year. The endpoints of the study were all-cause mortality and rehospitalization for heart failure (HF). The independent predictors of outcome were determined by Cox regression model. The quality of life of patients was evaluated at the end of the follow-up. Results: The age of this patient cohort was (678) years, 39.1% patients were male. The prevalence of ID was 54.4%.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated prevalence, incidence and resolution of ID and anaemia in 906 patients with chronic heart failure (median age 73 (65-79) years, 70% men, 51% with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction) 1 year apart. ID was defined as serum iron =13 mol/L and anaemia as haemoglobin <13.0 g/dL for men or <12.0 g/dL for women. FAIR-HF criteria for ID were also considered. At baseline, 10% had anaemia without ID, 23% had ID without anaemia, 20% had both, and 47% had neither. Percentages changed little over 1 year, but 157 (30%) patients had new-onset ID, 104 (16%) new-onset anaemia, whilst ID resolved in 173 (44%) and anaemia in 63 (23%). Compared to those who remained iron replete (iron >13 mol/L), mortality was higher in those with persistent or incident ID at 1 year [hazard ratio (HR) 1.81 (1.23-2.67), and HR 1.40 (0.91-2.14), respectively] in multivariable models (P = 0.02).

535,34066577_3,34066577, Multi-Nutrient Fortified Dairy-Based Drink Reduces Anaemia without Observed Adverse Effects on Gut Microbiota in Anaemic Malnourished Nigerian Toddlers: A Randomised Dose-Response Study. LI,"Prevalence of anaemia among Nigerian toddlers is reported to be high, and may cause significant morbidity, affects brain development and function, and results in weakness and fatigue. Although, iron fortification can reduce anaemia, yet the effect on gut microbiota is unclear. This open-label randomised study in anaemic malnourished Nigerian toddlers aimed to decrease anaemia without affecting pathogenic gut bacteria using a multi-nutrient fortified dairy-based drink. The test product was provided daily in different amounts (200, 400 or 600 mL, supplying 2.24, 4.48 and 6.72 mg of elemental iron, respectively) for 6 months. Haemoglobin, ferritin, and C-reactive protein concentrations were measured to determine anaemia, iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) prevalence. Faecal samples were collected to analyse gut microbiota composition. All three dosages reduced anaemia prevalence, to 47%, 27% and 18%, respectively. ID and IDA prevalence was low and did not significantly decrease over time. Regarding gut microbiota, Enterobacteriaceae decreased over time without differences between groups, whereas Bifidobacteriaceae and pathogenic E. coli were not affected. In conclusion, the multi-nutrient fortified dairy-based drink reduced anaemia in a dose-dependent way, without stimulating intestinal potential pathogenic bacteria, and thus appears to be safe and effective in treating anaemia in Nigerian toddlers.","iron deficiency,iron deficiency anaemia,",anaemic malnourished nigerian  ,"iron , respectively ) for 6 months .

LI","There is a lack of data on associations between modern vegetarian and vegan diets and health among children and adolescents. The aim of the Vechi Youth Study was to cross-sectionally examine anthropometry, dietary intakes and nutritional status in a sample of 149 vegetarian, 115 vegan and 137 omnivore children and adolescents (6-18 years old, mean age: 12.7  3.9 years). Group differences of dietary intake (calculated from three-day dietary records), nutrient biomarker and blood lipid concentrations were assessed using an analysis of covariance, adjusted for sex, age and other covariates. The total energy intake did not differ significantly between groups, but intake of carbohydrates was higher among vegetarians and vegans than among omnivores (p = 0.0002, respectively). The median protein intake exceeded 0.9 g/kg body weight/day in all diet groups and was lowest among vegetarians (p < 0.02). There was no significant difference of haemoglobin, vitamin B2, 25-OH vitamin D3, HDL-C and triglycerides blood concentrations between diet groups. Vegan participants had higher folate concentrations than vegetarian participants (p = 0.0053). Ferritin concentration was significantly higher in omnivores than in vegetarians (p = 0.0134) and vegans (p = 0.0404). Vegetarians had lower concentrations of holotranscobalamin (p = 0.0042) and higher concentrations of methylmalonic acid (p = 0.0253) than omnivores.

543,34103494_1,34103494, Maternal iron deficiency perturbs embryonic cardiovascular development in mice. ,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common class of human birth defects, with a prevalence of 0.9% of births. However, two-thirds of cases have an unknown cause, and many of these are thought to be caused by in utero exposure to environmental teratogens. Here we identify a potential teratogen causing CHD in mice: maternal iron deficiency (ID). We show that maternal ID in mice causes severe cardiovascular defects in the offspring. These defects likely arise from increased retinoic acid signalling in ID embryos. The defects can be prevented by iron administration in early pregnancy. It has also been proposed that teratogen exposure may potentiate the effects of genetic predisposition to CHD through gene-environment interaction. Here we show that maternal ID increases the severity of heart and craniofacial defects in a mouse model of Down syndrome. It will be important to understand if the effects of maternal ID seen here in mice may have clinical implications for women.","congenital heart disease, congenital heart disease, ,  common class, human birth defects,  congenital heart disease,iron deficiency,", ,"Congenital heart disease ( CHD ) is the most common class of human birth defects , with a prevalence of 0.9 % of births .

We aimed to describe the prevalence of excess iron and its determinants in healthy European adults. METHODS: Sociodemographic, lifestyle, iron status, dietary information, and HFE genotyping were obtained from controls from the nested case-control study EPIC-EurGast study. High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was measured to address possible systemic inflammation. Descriptive and multivariate analyses were used to assess iron status and its determinants. RESULTS: Out of the 828 participants (median age: 58.7 years), 43% were females. Median serum ferritin and prevalence of excess iron were 143.7 g/L and 35.2% in males, respectively, and 77 g/L and 20% in females, both increasing with latitude across Europe. Prevalence of HFE C282Y mutation was significantly higher in Northern and Central Europe (~ 11%) than in the South (5%). Overweight/obesity, age, and daily alcohol and heme iron intake were independent determinants for iron status, with sex differences even after excluding participants with hsCRP > 5 mg/L.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the yield of bacteriological tests, including blood and sputum cultures, and the association of multiple biomarkers and the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) with clinical and microbiological outcomes in patients with COVID-19 presenting to the emergency department (ED). METHODS: This is a substudy of a large observational cohort study (PredictED study). The PredictED included adult patients from whom a blood culture was drawn at the ED of Haga Teaching Hospital, The Netherlands. For this substudy, all patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR in March and April 2020 were included. The primary outcome was the incidence of bacterial coinfection. We used logistic regression analysis for associations of procalcitonin, C reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lymphocyte count and PSI score with a severe disease course, defined as intensive care unit admission and/or 30-day mortality. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) quantified the discriminatory performance. RESULTS: We included 142 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. On presentation, the median duration of symptoms was 8 days. 41 (29%) patients had a severe disease course and 24 (17%) died within 30 days. The incidence of bacterial coinfection was 2/142 (1.4%).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the yield of bacteriological tests, including blood and sputum cultures, and the association of multiple biomarkers and the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) with clinical and microbiological outcomes in patients with COVID-19 presenting to the emergency department (ED). METHODS: This is a substudy of a large observational cohort study (PredictED study). The PredictED included adult patients from whom a blood culture was drawn at the ED of Haga Teaching Hospital, The Netherlands. For this substudy, all patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR in March and April 2020 were included. The primary outcome was the incidence of bacterial coinfection. We used logistic regression analysis for associations of procalcitonin, C reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lymphocyte count and PSI score with a severe disease course, defined as intensive care unit admission and/or 30-day mortality. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) quantified the discriminatory performance. RESULTS: We included 142 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. On presentation, the median duration of symptoms was 8 days. 41 (29%) patients had a severe disease course and 24 (17%) died within 30 days. The incidence of bacterial coinfection was 2/142 (1.4%).

566,34592056_1,34592056, Impact of change in iron status over time on clinical outcomes in heart failure according to ejection fraction phenotype. ,"AIMS: The importance of iron deficiency (ID) in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is unknown. In HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), ID is reported as an independent predictor of mortality in HF although not all published studies agree. Different definitions of ID have been assessed, and the natural history of untreated ID not established, which may explain the conflicting results. This study aimed to assess the relationship between ID and mortality in HFpEF, clarify which definition of ID correlates best with outcomes in HFrEF, and determine the prognostic importance of change in ID status over time. METHODS AND RESULTS: Analyses were conducted on data from 1563 patients participating in a prospective international cohort study comparing HFpEF with HFrEF. Plasma samples from baseline and 6 month visits were analysed for the presence of ID. Two ID definitions were evaluated: ID(Ferritin) = 'ferritin < 100 mcg/L or ferritin 100-300 mcg/L + transferrin saturation < 20%' and ID(Tsat) = 'transferrin saturation < 20%'. The risk of all-cause mortality and death/HF hospitalization associated with baseline ID (ID(Ferritin) or ID(Tsat) ) and change in ID status at 6 months (persistent, resolving, developing, or never present) was estimated in multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Of 1563 patients, 1115 (71%) had HFrEF and 448 (29%) HFpEF. Prevalence of ID was similar in HFpEF and HFrEF (58%). Patients with ID were more likely to be female, diabetic, and have a higher co-morbid burden than patients without ID. ID by either definition did not confer independent risk for either all-cause mortality or death/HF hospitalization for patients with HFpEF [ID(Ferritin) hazard ratio (HR) 0.65 (95% confidence interval 0.40-1.05), P = 0.08; ID(Tsat) HR 1.16 (0.72-1.87), P = 0.55]. In the overall study cohort (HFrEF + HFpEF) and HFrEF subgroup, ID(Ferritin) was inferior to ID(Tsat) in prediction of all-cause mortality [overall cohort: HR 1.21 (0.95-1.53), P = 0.12 vs. HR 1.95 (1.52-2.51), P < 0.01; HFrEF: HR 1.12 (0.85-1.48), P = 0.43 vs. HR 1.57 (1.15-2.14), P < 0.01]. Persistence of ID(Tsat) at 6 months was strongly associated with poor outcomes compared with never having ID(Tsat) [HR 2.22 (1.42-3.46), P < 0.01] or having ID(Tsat) at baseline self-resolve by 6 months [HR 1.40 (1.06-1.86), P = 0.02]. CONCLUSIONS: Iron deficiency is equally prevalent in HFpEF and HFrEF but is negatively prognostic only in HFrEF. The natural history of ID is important; persistent ID is strongly associated with mortality whereas resolution is not. ID(Tsat) is the superior definition of ID and should inform future trials investigating the efficacy of intravenous iron replacement in patients with HFrEF.","change,  iron deficiency, similar, hfpef, iron deficiency,hazard ratio,",iron status  time  clinical outcomes    1563 patients,"baseline ID ( ID ( Ferritin ) or ID ( Tsat ) ) and change in ID status at 6 months ( persistent , resolving , developing , or never present ) was estimated in multivariable Cox proportional hazards models .

568,34592056_3,34592056, Impact of change in iron status over time on clinical outcomes in heart failure according to ejection fraction phenotype. ,"AIMS: The importance of iron deficiency (ID) in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is unknown. In HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), ID is reported as an independent predictor of mortality in HF although not all published studies agree. Different definitions of ID have been assessed, and the natural history of untreated ID not established, which may explain the conflicting results. This study aimed to assess the relationship between ID and mortality in HFpEF, clarify which definition of ID correlates best with outcomes in HFrEF, and determine the prognostic importance of change in ID status over time. METHODS AND RESULTS: Analyses were conducted on data from 1563 patients participating in a prospective international cohort study comparing HFpEF with HFrEF. Plasma samples from baseline and 6 month visits were analysed for the presence of ID. Two ID definitions were evaluated: ID(Ferritin) = 'ferritin < 100 mcg/L or ferritin 100-300 mcg/L + transferrin saturation < 20%' and ID(Tsat) = 'transferrin saturation < 20%'. The risk of all-cause mortality and death/HF hospitalization associated with baseline ID (ID(Ferritin) or ID(Tsat) ) and change in ID status at 6 months (persistent, resolving, developing, or never present) was estimated in multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Of 1563 patients, 1115 (71%) had HFrEF and 448 (29%) HFpEF. Prevalence of ID was similar in HFpEF and HFrEF (58%).

We studied the prevalence, distribution, and etiology of anemia in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and compared it with non-anemic patients. METHODS: Congestive heart failure (CHF) was diagnosed by modified Framingham criteria and ejection fraction (EF) <40%. Iron deficiency (ID) anemia was defined as serum ferritin level <100 ng/ml (absolute) or 100-300 ng/ml with transferrin saturation <20% (functional). Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency were defined as <200pg/ml and <4ng/ml respectively. RESULT: 688 patients with HFrEF were studied with an overall mean age of 57.213.8 years, and males outnumbering females (62.3% vs. 37.7%). Coronary artery disease (44.2%), dilated cardiomyopathy (46.8%), and valvular heart disease (6.7%) were major causes of CHF.Anemia was found in 63.9% of patients. Vit B12 deficiency, and folate deficiency were found in 107 (15.55%), and 54 (7.85%) subjects, respectively. Absolute ID was detected in 186 (42.27%) patients with anemia and 84 (33.87%) patients without anemia, while functional ID was present in 80 (18.18%) patients with anemia and 29 (11.69%) patients without anemia. Vitamin B12 deficiency was noted in 70 (15.9%) patients with anemia and 37 (14.9%) patients without anemia, while folate deficiency was noted in 31 (7.04%) patients with anemia and 23 (9.2%) patients without anemia. Hematinic deficiency among the study population was distributed equally among patients irrespective of EF, NYHA class, socioeconomic class diet pattern. CONCLUSION: The study shows that hematinic deficiency was seen even in non-anemic patients irrespective of diet pattern. Supplementation could be a strong strategy to improve outcomes in these patients of heart failure irrespective of anemia and should be evaluated in prospective studies.","congestive heart failure,ejection fraction,iron deficiency,", patients  heart failure  reduced ejection fraction    uncommon  patients,"is not uncommon in patients with heart failure .

570,34629786_1,34629786, Prevalence of Maternal Mortality and Clinical Course of Maternal Deaths in COVID-19 Pneumonia-A Cross-Sectional Study. ,"INTRODUCTION: After initial studies suggested that pregnant women were not at a higher risk of complications due to COVID-19 infection. Recent investigations from Sweden and the US have indicated that pregnant and postpartum women are at increased risk of severe complications associated with COVID-19. This study aims to find out the prevalence of maternal mortality and the clinical course of maternal mortality cases due to COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study was conducted from May 1st, 2020, to April 30th, 2021, at Postgraduate Institute and YCM Hospital Pimpri Pune (Maharashtra), a dedicated COVID hospital during COVID pandemic. During study period, all pregnant women who were diagnosed to have COVID-19 infection by RT PCR/Rapid Antigen Test were admitted and were enrolled for the study. AIM: To audit the maternal mortality due to COVID-19 infection. PRIMARY: To estimate the prevalence of maternal mortality due to COVID-19 infection in obstetric patients. SECONDARY: To systematically study and analyze the clinical course of infection in mothers who had mortality due to COVID-19 pneumonia. Data collected in standard format regarding Demography, clinical presentation, need for ICU/HDU, CXR findings, laboratory parameters and cases with maternal mortality were studied in detail to fulfill the study objectives. RESULTS: Among 871 COVID-19 cases diagnosed during pregnancy, nine patients had maternal mortality due to covid pneumonia. There was no obvious obstetric cause for mortality in these cases. The prevalence of maternal mortality was 0.01 (1.03%). Cases with maternal mortality were mostly in 3rd Trimester (5 of 9 cases) and presented with moderate to severe illness with breathlessness and myalgia in all 9 cases, cough and fever in 7 out of 9 cases, Tachypneoa was noted in all patients. Saturation below 90 in 6 cases and below 94 in 3 cases. Chest X-ray showed bilateral lung affection in all 9 cases. Leukocytosis with raised N:L ratio was predominantly seen, thrombocytopenia noted in 5 cases and elevated levels of acute phase reactants and inflammatory markers such as CRP, S. ferritin, ESR, LDH, D-dimer and S. fibrinogen was observed. None of the study participants received vaccine for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pneumonia is an additional toll for maternal mortality. Obstetric patients in 2nd and 3rd trimester having COVID-19 infection with late presentation to hospital, moderate to severe disease (RR > 30 min), with raised inflammatory markers (N:L ratio, CRP, Ferritin, d-Dimer, etc.) at presentation, having bilateral lung affection are at risk of poor maternal outcome.",maternal mortality,covid 19 pneumonia  cross sec nine patients,"CXR findings , laboratory parameters and cases with maternal mortality were studied in detail to fulfill the study objectives .

RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 56.62  14.74 years. Male: Female ratio was 2.78:1. Pre-existing CVDs were present in 258 patients (50.5%). The most common cardiovascular manifestation was acute coronary syndrome (ACS), seen in 259 patients (50.7%). ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) was more common than non-ST-segment elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS). Possible myocarditis was seen in 52 patients (10.1%). Rhythm and conduction abnormalities were noted in 144 patients (28.2%), the most common being QT prolongation, seen in 51 patients (10%). In-hospital mortality occurred in 97 patients (18.9%). Age, serum Ferritin level, D-dimer, NT-pro-BNP and total leukocyte count were significantly higher among patients with in-hospital mortality compared to survival group. Blood lymphocyte count and Haemoglobin level were significantly lower in mortality-group, compared to survival-group. Incidence of pre-existing CVDs, cardiogenic shock, heart failure, atrial fibrillation (AF), and renal failure were significantly higher in mortality-group compared to survival-group. CONCLUSION: The most common CVD in COVID-19 patients in our study was ACS. STEMI was more common than NSTE-ACS.

We aimed to assess clinical associates and pathophysiological pathways related to ID in this multimorbid syndrome. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 2151 patients with HF from the BIOSTAT-CHF cohort. Patients were stratified based on ID (transferrin saturation <20%), anaemia (World Health Organization definition) and/or CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) ). Patients were mainly men (73.3%), with a median age of 70.5 (interquartile range 61.4-78.1). ID was more prevalent than CKD and anaemia (63.3%, 47.2% and 35.6% respectively), with highest prevalence in those with concomitant CKD and anaemia (77.5% vs. 59.3%; p < 0.001). There was a considerable overlap in biomarkers and pathways between patients with isolated ID, anaemia or CKD, or in combination, with processes related to immunity, inflammation, cell survival and cancer amongst the common pathways.

585,35011874_1,35011874, Iron Deficiency in Heart Failure: Mechanisms and Pathophysiology. LI,"Iron is an essential micronutrient for a myriad of physiological processes in the body beyond erythropoiesis. Iron deficiency (ID) is a common comorbidity in patients with heart failure (HF), with a prevalence reaching up to 59% even in non-anaemic patients. ID impairs exercise capacity, reduces the quality of life, increases hospitalisation rate and mortality risk regardless of anaemia. Intravenously correcting ID has emerged as a promising treatment in HF as it has been shown to alleviate symptoms, improve quality of life and exercise capacity and reduce hospitalisations. However, the pathophysiology of ID in HF remains poorly characterised. Recognition of ID in HF triggered more research with the aim to explain how correcting ID improves HF status as well as the underlying causes of ID in the first place. In the past few years, significant progress has been made in understanding iron homeostasis by characterising the role of the iron-regulating hormone hepcidin, the effects of ID on skeletal and cardiac myocytes, kidneys and the immune system. In this review, we summarise the current knowledge and recent advances in the pathophysiology of ID in heart failure, the deleterious systemic and cellular consequences of ID.","hropoiesis, iron deficiency, iron deficiency, , common comorbidity, , heart failure, heart failure, , iron deficiency,heart failure,",heart failure: mechanisms     common comorbidity  patients,"Iron is an essential micronutrient for a myriad of physiological processes in the body beyond erythropoiesis .

Recent studies demonstrated iron metabolism and myocardial energy metabolism were altered in CHF patients. In this study, we aimed to analyze the effects and correlations of iron metabolism on myocardial energy metabolism in CHF. METHODS: One hundred and thirty patients with CHF [age: 66.211.5 years, males: 58.5% and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class (II/III/IV): 67/43/20] were included. Serum concentrations of ferritin, transferrin saturation (Tsat), and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) were quantified as the indexes of iron metabolism, and echocardiography was used to assess myocardial energy expenditure (MEE) levels. Iron deficiency (ID) was defined as ferritin <100 or 100-300 g/L with Tsat <20%. RESULTS: Patients with CHF were divided into two groups based on iron status. The prevalence of ID in CHF was 36.9%, and increased with the severity of CHF, reaching 80.0% in those with NYHA class IV (NYHA class II/III/IV: 17.9% vs. 46.5% vs. 80.0%, P=0.000). The demographic characteristics [age, sex, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and heart rate] and hemoglobin (HGB) concentrations in two groups were similar (all P>0.05). MEE was significantly higher in the ID group (92.723.0 vs. 65.620.8 cal/min, P=0.000), while NYHA classes II and III was significantly higher in the ID group (71.616.4 vs. 60.314.8 cal/min, P=0.022; 88.910.4 vs. 69.120.1 cal/min, P=0.000). In univariable linear regression models, the presence of ID, higher NYHA class, increased N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), sTfR, left ventricular internal diastolic diameter (LVIDd), as well as reduced ferritin, Tsat levels, and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were associated with elevated MEE levels (all P<0.05). In multivariable regression models, the presence of ID, reduced Tsat. and increased sTfR remained independent predictors of elevated MEE levels after adjustment for all variables that showed a significant association with MEE (all P<0.05).

MEE was significantly higher in the ID group (92.723.0 vs. 65.620.8 cal/min, P=0.000), while NYHA classes II and III was significantly higher in the ID group (71.616.4 vs. 60.314.8 cal/min, P=0.022; 88.910.4 vs. 69.120.1 cal/min, P=0.000). In univariable linear regression models, the presence of ID, higher NYHA class, increased N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), sTfR, left ventricular internal diastolic diameter (LVIDd), as well as reduced ferritin, Tsat levels, and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were associated with elevated MEE levels (all P<0.05). In multivariable regression models, the presence of ID, reduced Tsat. and increased sTfR remained independent predictors of elevated MEE levels after adjustment for all variables that showed a significant association with MEE (all P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of ID is high in CHF and is associated with the severity of cardiac dysfunction. The presence of ID as well as reduced Tsat and increased sTfR concentrations are associated with elevated MEE levels in CHF.","iron deficiency, chronic heart failure,  chronic heart failure,new york heart association,myocardial energy expenditure,iron deficiency",chronic heart failure patients patients  chronic heart failure  divided  two ,"Tsat < 20 % .

The relevance of ID in patients in recovery after acute stroke is not known. We assessed the prevalence of ID and anaemia in relation to functional capacity and to recovery during early rehabilitation after stroke. METHODS: This observational study enrolled consecutively 746 patients with ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke at in-patient early rehabilitation (age 68  13 years, female 47%, ischaemic stroke 87%). Functional capacity was assessed before and after rehabilitation using Barthel index (reha-BI), motricity index (MI), trunk control test (TCT), and functional ambulatory category (FAC). ID was defined as ferritin <100 g/L or as transferrin saturation (TSAT) < 20% if ferritin was 100- < 300 g/L or if CrP > 5 mg/L. Anaemia was defined as Hb < 12 g/dL (women) and <13 g/dL (men). RESULTS: The prevalence of ID and anaemia before rehabilitation were 45% and 46%, respectively, and remained high at discharge (after 27  17 days) at 40% and 48%, respectively. Patients with ID had lower functional capacity compared with patients without ID (reha-BI 20 [86] vs. 40 [80], MI 64 [66] vs. 77 [41], TCT 61 [76] vs. 100 [39], FAC 1 [4] vs. 4 [4]; median [IQR], all P < 0.001). ID was related to inflammation (OR 2.68 [95% CI 1.98-3.63], P < 0.001), female sex (OR 2.13 [95% CI 1.59-2.85], P < 0.001), haemorrhagic stroke (OR 1.70 [95% CI 1.11-2.61], P = 0.015), initial treatment on stroke unit (OR 3.59 [95% CI 1.08-11.89], P < 0.001), and anaemia (OR 2.94 [95% CI 2.18-3.96], P < 0.001), while age, BMI, and renal function were not related to ID. In adjusted analysis, ID was associated with low functional capacity in all functional scores: reha-BI (OR 1.66 [95% CI 1.08-2.54], P = 0.02), motricity index (OR 1.94 [95% CI 1.36-2.76], P < 0.001), trunk control test (OR 2.34 [95% CI] 1.64-3.32, P < 0.001) and functional ambulatory category (OR 1.77 [95% CI 1.2-2.63], P < 0.02).

ID was defined as ferritin <100 g/L or as transferrin saturation (TSAT) < 20% if ferritin was 100- < 300 g/L or if CrP > 5 mg/L. Anaemia was defined as Hb < 12 g/dL (women) and <13 g/dL (men). RESULTS: The prevalence of ID and anaemia before rehabilitation were 45% and 46%, respectively, and remained high at discharge (after 27  17 days) at 40% and 48%, respectively. Patients with ID had lower functional capacity compared with patients without ID (reha-BI 20 [86] vs. 40 [80], MI 64 [66] vs. 77 [41], TCT 61 [76] vs. 100 [39], FAC 1 [4] vs. 4 [4]; median [IQR], all P < 0.001). ID was related to inflammation (OR 2.68 [95% CI 1.98-3.63], P < 0.001), female sex (OR 2.13 [95% CI 1.59-2.85], P < 0.001), haemorrhagic stroke (OR 1.70 [95% CI 1.11-2.61], P = 0.015), initial treatment on stroke unit (OR 3.59 [95% CI 1.08-11.89], P < 0.001), and anaemia (OR 2.94 [95% CI 2.18-3.96], P < 0.001), while age, BMI, and renal function were not related to ID. In adjusted analysis, ID was associated with low functional capacity in all functional scores: reha-BI (OR 1.66 [95% CI 1.08-2.54], P = 0.02), motricity index (OR 1.94 [95% CI 1.36-2.76], P < 0.001), trunk control test (OR 2.34 [95% CI] 1.64-3.32, P < 0.001) and functional ambulatory category (OR 1.77 [95% CI 1.2-2.63], P < 0.02). Functional capacity improved during rehabilitation regardless of presence of ID, but functional outcome remained significantly lower in patients with ID at the end of rehabilitation (rehab BI and MI, both P < 0.001).

614,35222057_1,35222057," Iron Deficiency Impacts Diastolic Function, Aerobic Exercise Capacity, and Patient Phenotyping in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction: A Subanalysis of the OptimEx-Clin Study. ","AIMS: Iron deficiency (ID) is linked to reduced aerobic exercise capacity and poor prognosis in patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF); however, data for HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is scarce. We assessed the relationship between iron status and diastolic dysfunction as well as aerobic exercise capacity in HFpEF, and the contribution of iron status to patient phenotyping. METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 180 patients with HFpEF (66% women; median age, 71 years) recruited for the Optimizing Exercise Training in Prevention and Treatment of Diastolic HF (OptimEx-Clin) trial, baseline iron status, including iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation, was analyzed (n = 169) in addition to exercise capacity (peak oxygen uptake [peak V<U+0307>O(2)]) and diastolic function (E/e'). ID was present in 60% of patients and was more common in women. In multivariable linear regression models, we found that diastolic function and peak V<U+0307>O(2) were independently related to iron parameters; however, these relationships were present only in patients with HFpEF and ID [E/e' and iron: -0.19 (95% confidence interval -0.32, -0.07), p = 0.003; E/e' and transferrin saturation: -0.16 (-0.28, -0.04), p = 0.011; peak V<U+0307>O(2) and iron:  3.76 (1.08, 6.44), p = 0.007; peak V<U+0307>O(2) and transferrin saturation:  3.58 (0.99, 6.16), p = 0.007]. Applying machine learning, patients were classified into three phenogroups. One phenogroup was predominantly characterized by the female sex and few HFpEF risk factors but a high prevalence of ID (86%, p < 0.001 vs. other phenogroups). When excluding ID from the phenotyping analysis, results were negatively influenced. CONCLUSION: Iron parameters are independently associated with impaired diastolic function and low aerobic capacity in patients with HFpEF and ID.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate rates of infusion reactions among 4 commonly used intravenous iron repletion strategies and determine how readministration was managed in patients with history of reaction. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study included all patients receiving intravenous iron infusion from January 1, 2015, to September 7, 2021, at 6 centers in Portland, Oregon. Participants included a total of 12 237 patients with iron deficiency, not restricted by etiology. Statistical analysis was performed from September to October 2021. EXPOSURES: Type of intravenous iron formulation and concurrent administration of diphenhydramine, epinephrine, famotidine, and/or hydrocortisone, used as surrogate maker of infusion reaction.

RESULTS: Among 35 737 unique iron infusions (12 237 patients [9480 (77.5%) women; 717 (5.9%) Black; 10 250 (83.7%) White; mean (SD) age of 51 (20) years]), comprising 22 309 iron sucrose doses, 9067 iron dextran total doses (1771 preceded by test dose, 56 test doses alone), 3147 ferumoxytol doses, and 1214 ferric carboxymaltose doses, incidence of adverse events was 3.9% (n = 1389; 95% CI, 3.7%-4.1%). Rate of infusion events differed among iron formulations: 4.3% (n = 970; 95% CI, 4.1%-4.6%) iron sucrose, 3.8% (n = 345, 95% CI: 3.4%-4.2%) iron dextran (test and full doses or test dose alone), 1.8% (n = 57; 95% CI, 1.4%-2.3%) ferumoxytol, and 1.4% (n = 17, 95% CI, 0.8%-2.3%) ferric carboxymaltose (P < .001). Severe adverse events were exceedingly rare with only 2 documented epinephrine administrations, both associated with iron dextran. Incidence of adverse events among those who received premedication was 23-fold higher compared with those who did not (38.6% vs 1.7%, <U+03C7>21 = 7324.8; P < .001). Among 873 patients with history of infusion reaction who underwent readministration, the majority received the same formulation, which was associated with significantly higher reaction rate particularly if premedication was administered (68% [95% CI, 64%-72%] vs 32% [95% CI, 26%-41%], respectively), compared with those who received an alternate formulation (21% [95% CI, 11%-35%] vs 5% [95% CI, 2%-12%], respectively) (P < .001).

Rate of infusion events differed among iron formulations: 4.3% (n = 970; 95% CI, 4.1%-4.6%) iron sucrose, 3.8% (n = 345, 95% CI: 3.4%-4.2%) iron dextran (test and full doses or test dose alone), 1.8% (n = 57; 95% CI, 1.4%-2.3%) ferumoxytol, and 1.4% (n = 17, 95% CI, 0.8%-2.3%) ferric carboxymaltose (P < .001). Severe adverse events were exceedingly rare with only 2 documented epinephrine administrations, both associated with iron dextran. Incidence of adverse events among those who received premedication was 23-fold higher compared with those who did not (38.6% vs 1.7%, <U+03C7>21 = 7324.8; P < .001).

","BACKGROUND: The higher mortality rate in COVID-19 patients is still a concern. Though some studies mention that elderly patients with co-morbidities are at higher risk of mortality, some others report uneventful outcomes in young patients even without co-morbidities. Secondary bacterial and fungal infections, especially with nosocomial pathogens are known to be associated with worse outcome in the ongoing pandemic as well as in the previous viral outbreaks. In such a scenario, the outcome of hospitalized COVID-19 patients can be improved by timely identification of secondary infections using appropriate biomarkers and by following appropriate infection control measures to prevent the spread of nosocomial pathogens. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to find out the prevalence of bloodstream infections (BSI) among hospitalized COVID-19 patients and to analyze their laboratory markers and outcome by comparing them with those without BSI. METHODS: In this descriptive cross-sectional study, the prevalence of secondary BSI was determined among the hospitalized COVID-19 patients by including 388 blood culture bottles collected from 293 patients, which were received in the microbiology lab within the study period. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of BSI in COVID-19 patients was 39.5% (116/293), out of which 35.5% (104/293) infections were bacterial, and 4.1% (12/293) were fungal, while 8.9% (26/293) patients grew contaminants, and 51.5% (151/293) were sterile. Common causative agents of secondary BSI were found to be MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.9%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (8.8%) followed by Candida species (4.1%). Patients with co-morbidities like diabetes, hypertension and COPD were at higher risk of developing BSI with significantly higher levels of sepsis markers such as Creactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, ferritin and Interleukin-6 (IL-6).

630,35493097_1,35493097, Increased Serum Soluble Transferrin Receptor Levels Were Associated With High Prevalence of Cardiovascular Diseases: Insights From the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2017-2018. ,"Background: Iron deficiency is common in cardiovascular diseases (CVD), e.g., heart failure and coronary heart disease. Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) is a promising marker representing unmet cellular iron demands. However, whether higher serum sTfR is associated with increased risk of CVDs needs further investigation. Methods: In the present cross-sectional study, we analyzed data of 4,867 adult participants of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2017-2018. Linear regression models were employed to identify possible correlations between sTfR and other characteristics. The association between sTfR and CVDs was assessed with univariable and multivariable logistics regression models. Results: The prevalence of CVDs was 9.5% among participants, and higher sTfR levels were found in participants with CVDs (p < 0.001). Linear regression models revealed positive associations between sTfR and age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, glycated hemoglobulin A1c, and insulin resistance (all p < 0.001). In the multivariable logistics regression model, the adjusted odds ratio of sTfR for CVDs was 2.05 (per 1 log(2) mg/L, 95% confidence interval: 1.03~4.05, p = 0.046). Further subgroup analysis identified the associations of sTfR and CVDs were only significant in participants =60 years old, or with hypertension (all p < 0.05).

631,35692168_1,35692168, [Iron deficiency in Russia heart failure patients. Observational cross-sectional multicenter study]. ,"Aim To evaluate the prevalence of iron deficiency (ID) in Russian patients with heart failure (HF).Material and methods Iron metabolism variables were studied in 498 (198 women, 300 men) patients with HF. Data were evaluated at admission for HF (97 %) or during an outpatient visit (3 %). ID was determined according to the European Society of Cardiology Guidelines.Results 83.1 % of patients had ID; only 43.5 % of patients with ID had anemia. Patients with ID were older: 70.0 [63.0;79.0] vs. 66.0 years [57.0;75.2] (p=0.009). The number of patients with ID increased in parallel with the increase in HF functional class (FC). Among patients with ID, fewer people were past or current alcohol users (p=0.002), and a greater number of patients had atrial fibrillation (60.1 vs. 45.2 %, p=0.016). A multiple logistic regression showed that more severe HF (HF FC) was associated with a higher incidence of ID detection, whereas past alcohol use was associated with less pronounced ID.

640,35720171_1,35720171, Ethnic differences in adverse iron status in early pregnancy: a cross-sectional population-based study. ,"We studied ethnic differences in terms of iron status during pregnancy between Dutch women and other ethnicities and explore to what extent these differences can be explained by environmental factors. This cross-sectional population-based study (2002-2006) was embedded in the Generation R study and included a total of 4737 pregnant women from seven ethnic groups (Dutch, Turkish, Moroccan, Cape Verdean, Surinamese-Hindustani, Surinamese-Creole and Antillean). Ethnicity was defined according to the Dutch classification of ethnic background. Ferritin, iron and transferrin were measured in early pregnancy. The overall prevalence of iron deficiency was 7 %, ranging from 4 % in both Dutch and Surinamese-Creoles, to 18 % in Turkish, Moroccan and Surinamese-Hindustani women. Iron overload was most prevalent in Surinamese-Creole (11 %) and Dutch (9 %) women. Socioeconomic factors accounted for 5-36 % of the differences. Income was the strongest socioeconomic factor in the Cape Verdean and Surinamese-Hindustani groups and parity for the Turkish and Moroccan groups. Lifestyle determinants accounted for 8-14 % of the differences. In all groups, the strongest lifestyle factor was folic acid use, being associated with higher iron status.

","BACKGROUND Morbidity and mortality rates are high for patients returning to dialysis after renal graft failure. Keeping failed kidney transplants in situ with concomitant minimization or withdrawal of immunosuppression is standard of care in many transplant centers. It is unclear, however, whether the resulting allospecific immune response can cause a microinflammatory milieu. The present work investigated the impact of allograft nephrectomy on systemic inflammation, erythropoiesis, and donor-specific antibodies (DSA). MATERIAL AND METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis evaluating C-reactive protein (CRP), hemoglobin concentration (Hb), ferritin, iron substitution dosages, erythropoietin dosages, and DSA in 92 transplant recipients with allograft failure, of whom 49 did not (Group A) and 43 did undergo transplant nephrectomy (Group B). Blood samples and clinical data were obtained 3-6 months after returning to dialysis. We additionally assessed outcome of kidney re-transplantation in a 10-year follow-up. RESULTS There was no significant difference in Hb concentrations, ferritin concentrations, CRP concentrations, iron, and EPO substitution dosages between the 2 groups. Patients undergoing nephrectomy had a significantly higher prevalence of DSA (65.1% vs 38.8%, P<0.0001).

648,35862033_1,35862033, Same Day Infusion of Iron Therapy Is Associated With No Increased Risk for Adverse Events Among Patients Receiving Biological Infusions for Inflammatory Bowel Disease. ,"GOALS: The goal of this study was to compare the relative safety of administering iron infusions on the same day as intravenous (IV) biological therapy to the administration of these treatments on different days in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). BACKGROUND: IV iron therapy is often required in patients with IBD. Many patients with IBD who receive IV iron therapy in the outpatient setting also receive biological infusion therapy for treatment of their IBD. STUDY: Patients with IBD who received IV iron therapy at a single infusion center were included. We compared documented infusion-related reactions in patients with patients receiving an iron infusion on the same day as their biological infusion to those who received their iron infusion on a different day. RESULTS: Among 481 patients, 129 received an iron infusion on the same day as a biologic infusion. There was no significant difference in the incidence of infusion reaction when comparing patients who received biological infusion therapy in the same session as the iron infusion to those patients who received a biological infusion on a different day (5% vs. 7%, P =0.246) or any IBD-related therapy (5% vs. 8%, P =0.206). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency and type of infusion reactions in patients receiving IV iron therapy on the same day after IV therapy with biologics was not increased compared with patients who received a biological infusion on a different day. A sequential infusion of biological therapy followed by IV iron therapy may be a safe and cost-effective approach.","infusion reaction, comparing, , intravenous,inflammatory bowel disease,", among 481 patients,"RESULTS : Among 481 patients , 129 received an iron infusion on the same day as a biologic infusion .

654,36282723_1,36282723, Iron deficiency and cardiovascular disease. ,"Iron deficiency (ID) is common in patients with cardiovascular disease. Up to 60% of patients with coronary artery disease, and an even higher proportion of those with heart failure (HF) or pulmonary hypertension have ID; the evidence for cerebrovascular disease, aortic stenosis and atrial fibrillation is less robust. The prevalence of ID increases with the severity of cardiac and renal dysfunction and is probably more common amongst women. Insufficient dietary iron, reduced iron absorption due to increases in hepcidin secondary to the low-grade inflammation associated with atherosclerosis and congestion or reduced gastric acidity, and increased blood loss due to anti-thrombotic therapy or gastro-intestinal or renal disease may all cause ID. For older people in the general population and patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), both anaemia and ID are associated with a poor prognosis; each may confer independent risk. There is growing evidence that ID is an important therapeutic target for patients with HFrEF, even if they do not have anaemia. Whether this is also true for other HF phenotypes or patients with cardiovascular disease in general is currently unknown. Randomized trials showed that intravenous ferric carboxymaltose improved symptoms, health-related quality of life and exercise capacity and reduced hospitalizations for worsening HF in patients with HFrEF and mildly reduced ejection fraction (<50%). Since ID is easy to treat and is effective for patients with HFrEF, such patients should be investigated for possible ID. This recommendation may extend to other populations in the light of evidence from future trials.","iron deficiency increases,  severity, iron deficiency,heart failure,",  common  patients,"Iron deficiency ( ID ) is common in patients with cardiovascular disease .

The presence of iron deficiency limits erythropoiesis, leading to the development of anemia over time in patients with CHF, regardless of gender, race, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Observational studies demonstrate a higher prevalence of iron deficiency in women and in patients with higher NYHA (New York Heart Association) functional class, decreased LVEF, increased brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), or increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Iron deficiency and anemia in patients with CHF are independently associated with a decreased exercise capacity, hospitalizations for CHF, an increase in overall mortality and mortality from cardiovascular diseases. The clinical significance of iron deficiency requires the need to diagnose iron metabolism in all patients with CHF. Current guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of CHF indicate the need to determine the level of ferritin and saturation of transferrin in all patients with a suspected diagnosis of heart failure. The use of oral iron therapy in patients with CHF demonstrates its low efficacy in correcting this condition according to the clinical trials. At the same time the use of intravenous iron therapy is safe and improves symptoms, exercise capacity and quality of life in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and iron deficiency, which has been shown both in international placebo-controlled trials and meta-analyses.

664,36516789_1,36516789, Effects of Hyperferritinemia on Functional Outcome in Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients with Admission Hyperglycemia. ,"INTRODUCTION: Hyperferritinemia, presented as elevated serum ferritin level, is an indicator of high iron status which plays roles in secondary brain injury after acute ischemic stroke (AIS). However, the effects of hyperferritinemia and poor outcomes remain uncertain. Additionally, admission hyperglycemia quite frequently accompanies AIS patients, which is associated with unfavorable outcome. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effects of hyperferritinemia on 3-month and 1-year functional outcomes in AIS patients and especially those with admission hyperglycemia. METHODS: AIS patients within 24 h of onset were enrolled at West China Hospital from October 2016 to December 2019. Serum ferritin and blood glucose levels were tested on admission. Poor functional outcome at 3 months and 1 year was defined as modified Rankin Scale score =3. Multivariable analysis was used to investigate the associations between hyperferritinemia and 3-month and 1-year outcomes. Subgroup analysis was performed in patients with and without hyperglycemia. RESULTS: Of 723 patients (mean age 68.11 years, 60.6% males) finally included, 347 (48.0%) had hyperferritinemia. The incidence of poor outcome was 45.2% at 3 months and 41.2% at 1 year. Patients with hyperferritinemia had a higher frequency of poor 3-month outcome (51.8% vs. 39.2%, p = 0.001) and poor 1-year outcome (46.8% vs. 36.1%, p = 0.004). In all AIS patients, hyperferritinemia was not independently associated with poor functional outcome at 3 months or 1 year after adjusting for confounders (all p > 0.05). In AIS patients with hyperglycemia, hyperferritinemia was an independent factor correlated with poor 3-month outcome (OR = 1.711, 95% CI 1.093-2.681, p = 0.019) but not with poor 1-year outcome (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: High iron status, presented as hyperferritinemia, is associated with poor 3-month functional outcome in AIS patients with hyperglycemia. Evaluating serum ferritin level may be conducive to assess the risk of short-term poor outcome in AIS patients with hyperglycemia.

666,36516789_3,36516789, Effects of Hyperferritinemia on Functional Outcome in Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients with Admission Hyperglycemia. ,"INTRODUCTION: Hyperferritinemia, presented as elevated serum ferritin level, is an indicator of high iron status which plays roles in secondary brain injury after acute ischemic stroke (AIS). However, the effects of hyperferritinemia and poor outcomes remain uncertain. Additionally, admission hyperglycemia quite frequently accompanies AIS patients, which is associated with unfavorable outcome. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effects of hyperferritinemia on 3-month and 1-year functional outcomes in AIS patients and especially those with admission hyperglycemia. METHODS: AIS patients within 24 h of onset were enrolled at West China Hospital from October 2016 to December 2019. Serum ferritin and blood glucose levels were tested on admission. Poor functional outcome at 3 months and 1 year was defined as modified Rankin Scale score =3. Multivariable analysis was used to investigate the associations between hyperferritinemia and 3-month and 1-year outcomes. Subgroup analysis was performed in patients with and without hyperglycemia. RESULTS: Of 723 patients (mean age 68.11 years, 60.6% males) finally included, 347 (48.0%) had hyperferritinemia. The incidence of poor outcome was 45.2% at 3 months and 41.2% at 1 year. Patients with hyperferritinemia had a higher frequency of poor 3-month outcome (51.8% vs. 39.2%, p = 0.001) and poor 1-year outcome (46.8% vs. 36.1%, p = 0.004). In all AIS patients, hyperferritinemia was not independently associated with poor functional outcome at 3 months or 1 year after adjusting for confounders (all p > 0.05). In AIS patients with hyperglycemia, hyperferritinemia was an independent factor correlated with poor 3-month outcome (OR = 1.711, 95% CI 1.093-2.681, p = 0.019) but not with poor 1-year outcome (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: High iron status, presented as hyperferritinemia, is associated with poor 3-month functional outcome in AIS patients with hyperglycemia. Evaluating serum ferritin level may be conducive to assess the risk of short-term poor outcome in AIS patients with hyperglycemia. Further studies will be required to confirm our findings.","hyperferritinemia,  poor outcome,  acute ischemic stroke,",acute ischemic stroke patients  admission hyperglycemia subgroup analysis  performed  patients,".

672,36722321_1,36722321, Hypophosphataemia risk associated with ferric carboxymaltose in heart failure: A pooled analysis of clinical trials. LI,"AIMS: Iron deficiency is a common finding among patients with heart failure (HF) and is associated with adverse outcomes, including decreased quality of life, increased risk of hospitalization, and decreased survival. Intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) has been shown to improve outcomes among patients with HF and concomitant iron deficiency, but FCM is associated with an increased risk of hypophosphataemia. We aimed to better characterize this risk among HF populations. METHODS AND RESULTS: This pooled analysis examined data from 41 studies of adults with iron deficiency across disease states and therapeutic areas. Among the 7931 patients treated with FCM available for analysis, 14% made up the HF subgroup. Additional subgroups included women's health (36%), non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (NDD-CKD; 27%), haemodialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (HD-CKD; 1%), gastrointestinal (10%), neurology (3%), and other (10%). The incidence of post-baseline moderate or severe hypophosphataemia (i.e. serum phosphate [PO(4) (3-) ] level <2.0 mg/dL) varied across the therapeutic areas, with the lowest incidences observed in the HD-CKD (0%), HF (8.1%), and NDD-CKD (12.8%) subgroups. The prevalence of moderate or severe hypophosphataemia among the women's health, other, gastrointestinal, and neurology subgroups was 30.1%, 40.6%, 51.0%, and 55.6%, respectively. In the HF subgroup, one patient (<0.1%) had a serum PO(4) (3-) of <1.0 mg/dL recorded, compared with 4.8% and 4.0% of the subjects in the neurology and gastrointestinal groups, respectively. With the exception of the HD-CKD subgroup, mean serum PO(4) (3-) levels decreased through weeks 2 to 4, and then returned toward baseline and plateaued by week 8. The strongest predictor of hypophosphataemia was preserved kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate: >60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) vs. <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) ; odds ratio: 12.2). Among patients in the HF subgroup, the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events potentially related to hypophosphataemia (e.g. cardiac failure, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, fatigue, muscle weakness, bone pain, neurological symptoms, and muscle pain) was lower among FCM-treated patients than among those receiving placebo, and lower among patients with a post-baseline PO(4) (3-) <2 mg/dL vs. those not meeting such criteria.

LI,"AIMS: Iron deficiency is a common finding among patients with heart failure (HF) and is associated with adverse outcomes, including decreased quality of life, increased risk of hospitalization, and decreased survival. Intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) has been shown to improve outcomes among patients with HF and concomitant iron deficiency, but FCM is associated with an increased risk of hypophosphataemia. We aimed to better characterize this risk among HF populations. METHODS AND RESULTS: This pooled analysis examined data from 41 studies of adults with iron deficiency across disease states and therapeutic areas. Among the 7931 patients treated with FCM available for analysis, 14% made up the HF subgroup. Additional subgroups included women's health (36%), non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (NDD-CKD; 27%), haemodialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (HD-CKD; 1%), gastrointestinal (10%), neurology (3%), and other (10%). The incidence of post-baseline moderate or severe hypophosphataemia (i.e. serum phosphate [PO(4) (3-) ] level <2.0 mg/dL) varied across the therapeutic areas, with the lowest incidences observed in the HD-CKD (0%), HF (8.1%), and NDD-CKD (12.8%) subgroups. The prevalence of moderate or severe hypophosphataemia among the women's health, other, gastrointestinal, and neurology subgroups was 30.1%, 40.6%, 51.0%, and 55.6%, respectively. In the HF subgroup, one patient (<0.1%) had a serum PO(4) (3-) of <1.0 mg/dL recorded, compared with 4.8% and 4.0% of the subjects in the neurology and gastrointestinal groups, respectively. With the exception of the HD-CKD subgroup, mean serum PO(4) (3-) levels decreased through weeks 2 to 4, and then returned toward baseline and plateaued by week 8.

Among patients in the HF subgroup, the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events potentially related to hypophosphataemia (e.g. cardiac failure, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, fatigue, muscle weakness, bone pain, neurological symptoms, and muscle pain) was lower among FCM-treated patients than among those receiving placebo, and lower among patients with a post-baseline PO(4) (3-) <2 mg/dL vs. those not meeting such criteria. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of laboratory-assessed hypophosphataemia in HF patients treated with FCM was lower than that seen in patients in other therapeutic areas treated with FCM, and clinical events associated with hypophosphataemia are uncommon with FCM therapy in this population.

The prevalence of moderate or severe hypophosphataemia among the women's health, other, gastrointestinal, and neurology subgroups was 30.1%, 40.6%, 51.0%, and 55.6%, respectively.

Among patients in the HF subgroup, the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events potentially related to hypophosphataemia (e.g. cardiac failure, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, fatigue, muscle weakness, bone pain, neurological symptoms, and muscle pain) was lower among FCM-treated patients than among those receiving placebo, and lower among patients with a post-baseline PO(4) (3-) <2 mg/dL vs. those not meeting such criteria.

685,36722321_9,36722321, Hypophosphataemia risk associated with ferric carboxymaltose in heart failure: A pooled analysis of clinical trials. LI,"AIMS: Iron deficiency is a common finding among patients with heart failure (HF) and is associated with adverse outcomes, including decreased quality of life, increased risk of hospitalization, and decreased survival. Intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) has been shown to improve outcomes among patients with HF and concomitant iron deficiency, but FCM is associated with an increased risk of hypophosphataemia. We aimed to better characterize this risk among HF populations. METHODS AND RESULTS: This pooled analysis examined data from 41 studies of adults with iron deficiency across disease states and therapeutic areas. Among the 7931 patients treated with FCM available for analysis, 14% made up the HF subgroup. Additional subgroups included women's health (36%), non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (NDD-CKD; 27%), haemodialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (HD-CKD; 1%), gastrointestinal (10%), neurology (3%), and other (10%). The incidence of post-baseline moderate or severe hypophosphataemia (i.e. serum phosphate [PO(4) (3-) ] level <2.0 mg/dL) varied across the therapeutic areas, with the lowest incidences observed in the HD-CKD (0%), HF (8.1%), and NDD-CKD (12.8%) subgroups. The prevalence of moderate or severe hypophosphataemia among the women's health, other, gastrointestinal, and neurology subgroups was 30.1%, 40.6%, 51.0%, and 55.6%, respectively. In the HF subgroup, one patient (<0.1%) had a serum PO(4) (3-) of <1.0 mg/dL recorded, compared with 4.8% and 4.0% of the subjects in the neurology and gastrointestinal groups, respectively. With the exception of the HD-CKD subgroup, mean serum PO(4) (3-) levels decreased through weeks 2 to 4, and then returned toward baseline and plateaued by week 8. The strongest predictor of hypophosphataemia was preserved kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate: >60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) vs. <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) ; odds ratio: 12.2).

OBJECTIVES: This study investigated associations of various sociodemographic, lifestyle, medication, and dietary factors with body iron stores among pre- and postmenopausal women in Canada. METHODS: Analyses were conducted using cross-sectional, nationally representative survey and biomarker data from women aged 20-79 y (n = 6362) in the Canadian Health Measures Survey (2009-2017). Body iron stores were assessed by measuring serum concentrations of ferritin (SF). Information on potential correlates was collected during an in-home interview. Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate associations with SF concentration, and logistic regression was used to estimate associations with iron deficiency (SF <15 g/L) or elevated iron stores (SF >150 g/L). RESULTS: Geometric mean SF concentrations were significantly higher in postmenopausal than in premenopausal women (73.2 versus 33.8 g/L; P < 0.001). The prevalence of iron deficiency among pre- and postmenopausal women was 16.0% and 4.0%, respectively, whereas that of elevated iron stores was 2.7% and 21.0%, respectively. After simultaneous adjustment for multiple factors, including high-sensitivity CRP (inflammation marker), we found that age, East/Southeast Asian (versus White) race/ethnicity, alcohol, and red meat consumption were positively associated with SF concentration among pre- and postmenopausal women. In addition, aspirin use and dairy consumption were inversely associated with SF concentration among postmenopausal women only. Similar patterns were observed for associations with elevated iron stores among postmenopausal women, whereas higher grain consumption was associated with an increased prevalence of iron deficiency among premenopausal women.

","INTRODUCTION: iron deficiency (ID) is the most prevalent nutritional problem worldwide with children being the most vulnerable. In children with congenital heart defect (CHD), ID may lead to iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) which carries a poor prognosis due to exacerbation of left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. This study assessed the prevalence and factors associated with ID and IDA among children with CHD at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) and Jakaya Kikwete Cardiac Institute (JKCI) in Tanzania. METHODS: a descriptive hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 238 participants with echocardiography confirmed CHD presenting at MNH and JKCI. A structured questionnaire was used to collect demographic data and medical history. Anthropometric measurements were done and blood samples for evaluation of complete blood count, serum ferritin and C-reactive protein were collected. Descriptive statistics such as frequencies, percentages, median with interquartile range, were used to describe study participants. Comparison of continuous variables was performed using Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test as appropriate and Chi-square (x2) test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables to determine associations. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated to determine risk factors for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia. All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 20 and p-value =0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: characteristic of study participant majority 66.4% (n 158) were less than 60 month of age with nearly equal number of male 51.3%(122) to female 48.7% (n 116). The overall prevalence of anaemia among study participants was 47.5% (n 238) with mild, moderate and severe anaemia being 21.4%, 21.4% and 4.6% respectively. The prevalence of iron deficiency was 26.9% (n 64) and that of iron deficiency anaemia was 20.2% (n 48).

697,36879640_8,36879640," Prevalence of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia among children with congenital heart defects at tertiary hospitals in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania: a cross-sectional study. ","INTRODUCTION: iron deficiency (ID) is the most prevalent nutritional problem worldwide with children being the most vulnerable. In children with congenital heart defect (CHD), ID may lead to iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) which carries a poor prognosis due to exacerbation of left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. This study assessed the prevalence and factors associated with ID and IDA among children with CHD at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) and Jakaya Kikwete Cardiac Institute (JKCI) in Tanzania. METHODS: a descriptive hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 238 participants with echocardiography confirmed CHD presenting at MNH and JKCI. A structured questionnaire was used to collect demographic data and medical history. Anthropometric measurements were done and blood samples for evaluation of complete blood count, serum ferritin and C-reactive protein were collected. Descriptive statistics such as frequencies, percentages, median with interquartile range, were used to describe study participants. Comparison of continuous variables was performed using Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test as appropriate and Chi-square (x2) test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables to determine associations. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated to determine risk factors for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia. All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 20 and p-value =0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: characteristic of study participant majority 66.4% (n 158) were less than 60 month of age with nearly equal number of male 51.3%(122) to female 48.7% (n 116). The overall prevalence of anaemia among study participants was 47.5% (n 238) with mild, moderate and severe anaemia being 21.4%, 21.4% and 4.6% respectively. The prevalence of iron deficiency was 26.9% (n 64) and that of iron deficiency anaemia was 20.2% (n 48). Age below 5 years, cyanotic CHD, history of recent illness and less consumption of red meat were significantly associated with iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anaemia (IDA). After controlling for independent variables, history of recent illness aOR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22-0.98 P 0.045 less frequent consumption of red meat aOR 0.11 95% CI 0.04-0.32 P <0.001 and cyanotic CHD aOR: 0.40, 95% CI 0.18-0.87; p 0.021, were associated with of iron deficiency similarly age below 5 years aOR 0.33 0, 95% CI 14-0.89 P 0.02 early weaning practices aOR 0.50 95% CI 0.23-0.97 P 0.050 less frequent consumption of red meat aOR 0.07 CI (0.02-0.24 p <0.01 were significantly associated with iron deficiency anaemia. CONCLUSION: nearly half of the children with CHD in this study had anaemia, more than a quarter had ID and one-fifth had IDA. Routine screening and management of both ID and IDA in children with CHD should be practised during weaning and throughout the childhood to prevent ventricular dysfunction further heart failure.","anaemia among study participants,  iron deficiency,congenital heart defect,iron deficiency anaemia,muhimbili national hospital",dar es salaam tanzania:  cros ,"female 48.7 % ( n 116 ) .

The present study consisted of all lung cancer deaths (N = 220) that occurred within this cohort between 1950 and 1989. both living and dead controls, matched on race and attained age, were selected in the ratio of 10:1 (N = 2200) by means of the incidence density sampling procedure. All cases and two controls per case, randomly selected from each case's 10 controls, were included in a smoking history survey. Basic smoking history information was obtained for about 71% of these study subjects. For the purpose of this study, formaldehyde exposure levels were categorized as high, medium, low, and none. Airborne silica exposure was categorized only as high, medium, and low levels, because all foundry workers were known to be exposed to silica. Conditional logistic regression analyses indicated that cigarette smoking was a strong predictor of lung cancer mortality in this cohort.

The importance of the presence of pulmonary hypertension]. ,"PURPOSE: To assess the nutritional status of children with congenital heart disease with left-to-right shunt and the nutritional disturbances related to the presence of pulmonary hypertension (PH). METHODS: In a prospective study, the nutritional status of 30 children with left-to-right shunt (16 with and 14 without PH) was determined by anthropometric parameters and plasma proteins albumin, transferrin and prealbumin. Frequency and extent of nutritional disturbances were analysed in relation to the presence of PH. A control group of 20 well-nourished children was formed, aiming to compare the values of the serum proteins. RESULTS: The nutritional classification according to Waterlow's criteria showed an overall prevalence of malnutrition of 83.3%, which was higher in those with PH (p = 0.0140). This patient's group was more wasted than the group without PH (median z score of weight for height -1.65 vs -0.78). There was a high occurrence of measurements of arm fat area below the 5th percentile, which were similar in both groups. Serum levels of albumin and prealbumin were significantly lower in children with congenital heart disease than in the control group and transferrin values were similar in both. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of malnutrition was high. The presence of PH was associated with higher nutritional disturbance. The nutritional assessment may be a good way to identify diagnostic groups at particular risk of failure to thrive. This can be useful in planning a management which ensures these patients to achieve adequate nutritional supplementation in early life.","malnutrition,  pulmonary hypertension,", ,"plasma proteins albumin , transferrin and prealbumin .

Thirteen digestive fistulas of 113 patients (11.9%) submitted to gastrectomy during the period 1989-1994 represent the study population. The incidence of postoperative fistulas was compared to the kind of gastric pathology, to the extension of gastrectomy, to different nutritional (serum haemoglobin, albumin and transferrin level, weight loss) and immunological factors (serum lymphocytes) and, for oncological patients, to the stage of the disease. Incidence was directly related to the extension of gastrectomy, to serum albumin and haemoglobin level, and to weight loss rate. The results were not statistically significant at Kruskal-Wallis and ANOVA tests. No relation was found between incidence of fistulas and serum transferrin level, number of lymphocytes and adoption of early postoperative enteral nutrition. Six patients had spontaneous closure of the fistula with conservative therapy. Seven patients required reoperation because of abdominal sepsis (53.8%). Three patients died (23%). Although spontaneous closure, reoperation and mortality were related to nutritional and immunological state, no examined variables showed a statistically significative relation. The adoption of early postoperative enteral nutrition was not related to the prognosis, unlike the stage of the disease: patients submitted to reoperation had a TNM III or IV stage; dead patients had a TNM IV stage. Treatment of metabolic-nutritional unbalance can prevent anastomotic failure and fistula after gastrectomy and improve the prognosis.

716,9358830_1,9358830," Physical activity, change in blood pressure and predictors of mortality in older South Africans--a 2-year follow-up study. ","OBJECTIVE: A 2-year follow-up study of a cohort of 200 historically disadvantaged older South Africans was conducted to: (i) characterise current levels of habitual physical activity; (ii) relate physical activity to current risk factors for chronic disease; and (iii) identify risk factors associated with 2-year mortality. The baseline sample, drawn in 1993, was found to have a high prevalence of hypertension (71.7%). RESEARCH DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: A baseline sample of 200 persons aged > or = 65 years, resident in the Cape Peninsula, was randomly drawn by means of a two-stage cluster design. Baseline measurements included: anthropometry, waist/hip ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), serum albumin, serum ferritin, haemoglobin and fasting plasma glucose levels, plasma lipid profiles, oral glucose tolerance test and self-reported health status. Subjects were revisited after 2 years, at which time an adapted version of the Yale Physical Activity Survey was administered and measurements of blood pressure and anthropometry were repeated. STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Spearman's rank-order correlations were used to describe relationships between various current risk factors and physical activity. Logistic regression was used to determine predictors of 2-year mortality from baseline data. RESULTS: At follow-up, 142 of the subjects (66 men, 76 women) were traced and measurements collected. Thirty-two subjects were reported to have died by relatives living in the same household (22 men, 10 women). Levels of reported physical activity in the survivors were two-thirds lower than those reported in a sample of North Americans of similar age. There was an inverse association between age and physical activity (r = -0.31; P < 0.0005) and a positive association between BMI and physical activity (r = 0.29; P < 0.005). There was, however, no association between physical activity and systolic or diastolic blood pressure. In men, BMI in the lower tertile (P = 0.07) and serum ferritin levels were positively associated with increased mortality. Serum albumin levels were protective over the 2-year follow-up period (OR = 0.85; P < 0.05). In women, being diabetic (OR = 4.88; P = 0.06) and having a waist/hip ratio in the upper tertile (OR = 3.26; P = 0.06) were associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity levels in this sample of older historically disadvantaged South Africans were habitually low. Simple anthropometric assessments incorporating weight and waist/hip ratio, together with serum albumin measurements, may be useful to screen general health risk for older adults at primary care level and provide indications for social or medical intervention. Further, strategies for earlier detection and effective management of diabetes, particularly in older women, may reduce premature mortality in this population.","hypertension, body mass index,",blood pressure  predictors  ,"Africans was conducted to : ( i ) characterise current levels of habitual physical activity ; ( ii ) relate physical activity to current risk factors for chronic disease ; and ( iii ) identify risk factors associated with 2-year mortality .
